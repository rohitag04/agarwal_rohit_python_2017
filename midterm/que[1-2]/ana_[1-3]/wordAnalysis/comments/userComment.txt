As long as Trump is willing to essentially gut NATO, to leave the Middle East stage to Putin, to allow Putin;s extension of his Greater Russia realm, I think Trump and Putin can indeed be buddies.<br/><br/>There is one aspect of Trump living in the White House I find interesting. He seems willing to help accomplishing the GOP dream of upsetting the Federal apple cart up to this point but given that he has no basic belief and no principle in term of governance the consequence of his action and inaction is unpredictable. So as long as he does not blow up the world by playing with the nuclear code maybe the world does indeed need some dosage of his unpredictable "medicine".<br/><br/>As the Taoist said: A calamity is what a blessing leans on, and hidden in a blessing is a calamity". So is Trump living a White House a blessing or a calamity? We will find out, I suspect, in two years assuming he does not blow up the world by then.I submit that an underlying problem causing media deficit attention arises from the great number of outlets working feverishly to fill up the 24/7 all news all the time cycle.  Media and their editors and executives are under pressure to produce content whether it's a cable news network or a news oriented website.  It's clear that such outlets abhor a vacuum and the filler provided by a circus act like Trump is easy and plentiful.  A windfall for Les Moonves and plenty of air time provided by CNN's decision to broadcast entire incoherent speeches of the President -Elect. <br/><br/>The 24/7 news cycle is the American rat race writ large.  A pause, an evaluation of what is reported is sorely needed. A pundit recently suggested that every Trump tweet not be reported on unless truly newsworthy. That would be a start.  Like any machine or engine, if the 24/7 pressure to fill a void does not dial back , the breakdown of 2016 will continue unabated.Cost America influence and prestige? How many lives were saved? That is the only thing that matters.A few nights ago, I again watched the Maysles' brothers documentary "Grey Gardens" about the Beale mother and daughter, Edith and little Edie.  Although their living conditions were so tragic, the dynamic between that mother and daughter somehow came to mind when I saw previews of the upcoming Reynolds/Fisher film.   Everything was a little frenetic with the Beales, with each woman sometimes irritated by the other but still very much needing the connection, something many of us daughters can relate to.<br/><br/>I am so sorry for Carrie's daughter and brother.  I hope they take comfort from the outpouring of affection from the public.Let's get the facts straight.<br/><br/>Bill Clinton didn't abolish the Fairness Doctrine. It was abolished under Reagan at the instigation of Lewis Powell a decade earlier. (Google "Powell memorandum.") For his reengineering of America to be taken over by the American right, Powell was rewarded with the Supreme Court. Corporate America asked Powell how to squash the American left. He told them and corporate America made it happen. Just as corporate America today dictates the "news" agenda of the country. <br/><br/>To see the truth of that, one need only watch network television coverage of election night. The anchors were positively bemused by the result and anybody sitting with them who wanted to take it remotely seriously was quickly shut up. Why? Because contrary to the 40-year campaign by the American right, television "journalists" aren't liberals. Most couldn't care less who's president. As members of the political and economic elite, it doesn't affect their lives a bit. (If they care at all, they like Republicans. Witness their coverage of Hillary Clinton.) What broadcast "journalists" care most about is keeping their corporate bosses happy and keeping seven-figure paychecks. (Witness CBS's abandonment of Dan Rather when the story he reported was, contrary to conventional wisdom, reported accurately.) I speak as someone who once lived inside the media elite. If we're counting on American "journalism" to save us from fascism, we're cooked.It's only "fearmongering" if the threat isn't real.<br/><br/>I hope I'm right, that Trump won't cook the planet beyond all hope, won't sell out  those who will need Medicare and Social Security and the sort of help the ACA offered, imperfectly. I hope his tenure won't further embolden the voices of bigotry and racism the United States has had to  beat back for its entire history. But I am afraid. And I think you should be too. and Elke<br/>Not yet 2017 here.<br/>I'll OWN UP TO it- am not as SMART as I thought.

And it's probably not meaningful to Mr Kristof's readership numbers.  It's not likely any Trump supporters will be enlightened on this issue here...  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, for over 1 year our military generals have been calling global warming a major national security risk.  So now I wonder, will their position on global warming  likely clash with Trump's views, prompting Trump to dismiss the generals concerns in similar fashion as he's dissed the CIA and FBI over the Russian election hacking issue?  @dan Stackhouse:   Unbelievably astute comment! Thank you, you've nailed it in your parable-like way.It's not fear-mongering if it's actually true. The Russians actually came! They may have been a determining factor in the election of Trump. As a former journalism student who was an editor on the daily university paper at a public institution of 25,000 in the Midwest, I have to disagree that we were molded in the likeness of left-wing faculty.<br/><br/>My experience and observation is that my journalism peers veer left of center due to what we see and report working on the paper.  Getting the sheepskin is important, but secondary to building a clipbook of stories garnered from real-world reporting.  The real world isn't pretty, nor is it fair.It's not so much media's failure as other pols. For example, the Dem party can start taking control of some of the narrative by having one or more fire brands or the next big things make statements via Soc Media that bring attention to subjects not being discussed or a completely unexpected take on something being discussed rather than just responding to something other parties or the media says. Better yet, add Trump's name to the statement so it gets his attention and gets him talking about or defending the opposite.What seems to me to be missing here is a hard look at media consumers and voters.  The loss of analysis and depth of reporting has been happening for decades, and most Americans seem quite willing to accept it.  I really hope the news media do try to do a better job, but what if they do and they start losing money by it?<br/><br/>On a related note, I think the media's failure to push voters they interviewed has contributed to this mess.  I heard endless interviews with Trump supporters who were not challenged about Trump's lies, pandering to racism, or complete lack of understanding of issues.  I believe this contributed to the idea that he is somehow acceptable.I don't know how large your income, and I have no idea of what your net worth is, but I know for sure that in both of these categories yours are exponentially greater than mine. In other words, you are one of those rich people you pillory, and every bit as greedy, I'm sure.<br/><br/>But let's cut to the chase--taxes! You like taxing the rich because you collect a princely (by my standards) sum of money from taxes, indirectly, perhaps, in your salary from a university that gets lots of taxpayers' money from the government, and directly when you obtain a government grant for some worthy--in you opinion--project or study.<br/><br/>"A heavy, progressive income tax," as recommended by Karl Marx in his communist manifesto, "by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property," is what we now have in America. The federal, individual income tax "brackets" range from 10% on incomes of less than $13,250, to 39.6% for incomes above $441,000. Obviously, an across-the-board tax reduction of say 10% will yield a much greater dollar reduction for the person in the highest income bracket than someone in the lowest brackets. Unless one's objective is to punish the rich taxpayer even more than he already is, the across-the-board cut looks eminently fair.  The rich guy earning $441,000 will still be paying 131 times more money in taxes than the poor gal earning $13,250. 131 times more! I would think Marx would be satisfied if not Professor Krugman.Good point. However, it is more than just the need to fill all that air time. It is the need to fill it cheaply. The more there is to fill, the less can be spent on each minute of content filling it.<br/><br/>They could fill it with actual reporting. Real reporting is expensive, and real reporters with knowledge are more expensive.<br/><br/>It is cheaper and faster to fill it as a megaphone for whoever feeds young cheap hires with press releases or does something flashy or outrageous in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Budgets were cut as time filled increased. Reporting bureaux closed and experienced reporters fired even as more "reports" came in. Editors who might question and demand were the first to go.One place to look is television news.  How many days and nights did they runs stories labeled "Email Scandal" only to say nothing substantive or in any related to any sort of "scandal?"  They nustbparroted whatever Trump and his minions said.  The lazy coverage of this issue dominated the final weeks of the campaign.   Nor did they do anything to counter the endless baseless accusations about Benghazi and every other weak accusation hurled at Secretary  Clinton. All they did was amplify the character assassinations. Whatever happened to investigating and reporting news instead of just replay sound bites with no substance behind these blurbs. No investigations. No pointing out the falsehoods and baseless accusations. Mere parroting. Shame.Like recovering the economy, restoring respect to the United States, doing what he can to promote and protect the environment?

But<br/>all the Media attention is the real 800 pound gorilla that got Trump elected. <br/><br/>Every news site seem to have Trump in at least half the political news. I guess Trump's absurd stamements and outrageous tweet's made for entertaining gee whiz reporting. Suddenly serious politicians like Hilary and Bernie were being compared with a tweeting hypersensitive political newbie.<br/><br/>The media's insistence on false equivalences played a big part in Trump "victory". Where's somebody like Walter Cronkite these days?As a cemetery enthusiast who likes to find the final resting places of people generally worthy of admiration, I hope Todd selects a final resting place that is in good taste, and will accommodate fans who wish to pay their respects. <br/><br/>No crypts deep in the non public areas of Forest Lawn.   A nice grave site at Westwood Village Cemetery would be ideal."Godsend'? In what way is Trump doing the Lords work? I think you are wrong in your support of the conservatives. They are gearing up to cut Medicare and the ACA. There will be nothing to replace those programs. I work in healthcare.  It won’t  long before insurance becomes un-affordable and they are kicking women with breast cancer out of their plans. The poor and the elderly will be made to go without so that the wealthy can have more tax cuts. How do you reconcile that with your Christian background? I worry about my community and family. Every dollar removed from someone poor, retired or working class, makes my town poorer. Why should anyone be happy about that? Trump is an empty vessel and he is no Christian. He will go along with the cuts, because there will be tax cuts for the wealthy like him to be gained. At what point will you say enough?Don't forget: Trump agreed to release his income tax returns.Trump is a dangerous vengeful conscienceless shallow ego-obsessed fool, bent on selling our country for thirty pieces of silver, without regret and without knowledge of the destruction he plans.<br/><br/>I doubt there is much Obama can do to prevent the coming dangerous degradation of American, which is about to be made small and mean and broken.<br/><br/>God help us all (and I'm an atheist).One of the best tributes ever.

Justin Gillis is extraordinary, and there are half a dozen other good reporters.

You're not Ivanka who can, according to her dad, "Just go work somewhere else."I cannot participate in the march because I'm out of the country but I would not if I could. I am part of a Facebook group for supporters of Hillary. For a long time I found many posts inane or irritating: they were often by women who exaggerated some trivial everyday slight into a momentous political event and then solicited virtual hugs and support from total strangers. But I gave up on that "movement" when a black woman wrote a post castigating everybody white and demanding "informed listening" instead of daring to voice their opinions. Sorry I won't be shamed into keeping my mouth shut just because of the color of your skin. I get it that it's hard to be a black woman in the US. I was born a Jew in the USSR. Care to know what happened to my grandparents? And if you don't, why should I care to know what happened to your slave ancestors? I've known many women who suffered unimaginable hardships: a Chinese whose parents starved to death in Mao's famine; an Arab in Israel who has to fight both the conservatism of her own community and the discrimination by the Jewish majority; a Ukrainian who cleans other people's houses because she lost everything she had in Putin's war. None of them whined, tried to shut up others or declined well-meaning help from people who were luckier than they.Sarah,<br/><br/>This article is, in part, about black women not being heard. You only mention black men and white women in your comment.  <br/><br/>Many of these comments, imploring black women to see the larger picture and not worry about race right now, sound eerily like the 1970s feminist movement and unintentional alienation of women of color by white spokeswomen and participants.<br/><br/>If you see Gloria Steinem, ask what she thinks of Shirley Chisholm now.The left and the right both have their extremes.

Very hard to see. It too a lot of effort on my part to see it. Reading. Listening.   In the end- if the doors are open to all - we all win. We white women are not being honest with ourselves if we don't acknowledge that we benefit from "white privilege"  and not one of us really knows how it feels to be a person of color in the US.

Not everything built and made of concrete is useful, and having schools built is not important if our freedoms are taken away from us. In fact most of the USA is built on the basis of a piece of paper. The groundwork for that school is not solid.<br/>I personally buy as many things as I can that are made in America rather than imports, I very much agree with that value. American freedoms are priceless and I am marching for that very unconcrete value, worth every penny. Going to a march is respectable.

I could go on. Women of color, too, are not a monolithic group. Those who are citizens have privilege over those who are undocumented, those who speak English over those who don't, and those with educations over those without.

They are all related.  Had they not done that Clinton would have won the electoral college. So Democrats had opposition research on Trump that they did not use. <br/><br/>Why didn't Hillary use it, if it is such good stuff? <br/><br/>Perhaps it was unreliable. That idea brings to mind Dan Rather's report on W's Air National Guard behavior, and the blowback that came of its failure.<br/><br/>Perhaps fear of retaliation?

Have you conveniently forgotten that Mitch McConnell stated, after Obama's<br/>inauguration in 2009, that the job of the Republicans in Congress was to make sure the President only served one term? Do you think that was "dignified and professional"? You guys need to get it straight.  The majority of Democratic voters supported Hillary.  We saw Bernie's slogans and stump speech for what they were...phony rhetoric meant to appeal to a lot of children.  Bernie would have been squashed like a fly going against Trump.   Nobody stole anything.  You guys were taken in by a demagogue, who could have accomplished none of his promises of freebies for all of you.  Those who stupidly withheld their votes or voted for a third party gave this to Trump.  Collectively we need to learn that our actions have consequences.  Such tests of maturity either benefit an advancing civilization or are repeated in varying contexts, until learned. That's how we all learn mature cooperation, and how we learn collectively as well.  Mr. Trump will likely bring a ton of sunlight into some of America's darkest impulses, for us to see and consider.<br/><br/>Mr. Trump will have his ego-stage, the would-be manipulators their opportunities, the loyal opposition their resistance for other than pearls, and we, the living, can hope the consequences are not violent tests.  <br/><br/>We need to understand who we are collectively in order to see who we want to become.Just my point. The Confederate States of America have won the Civil War or as they say... The War Between the States..I think the Civil War was a mistake. States have the right to secede. We should have let them go. Let them have their states' rights. <br/><br/>I believe Congress and the Supreme Court should make it easier for them to secede. The U.S. would be much better off without Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas. I only would be sorry to lose New Orleans and Austin. Perhaps we could have a population exchange with Staten Island. <br/><br/>The only problem is refugees and immigrants. I think we should allow southerners into the U.S. provided they demonstrate that they are willing to accept the Bill of Rights and to assimilate and adopt American ways. conway is just a hired mouthpiece, not a good person, but not as foul as trump and sessions.Today Dylan Roof, a 22 year old mentally ill, racist was given the death penalty. 22 years old.  What a waste of a life. But it has been lost in the political rhetoric. Nine innocent people died! Mr. Sessions, Mr Trump, whether willing to admit it or not, fostered young men like Mr. Roof. Adults like them only reinforce racist attitudes. They give permission to make fun of and bully others.To kill. I've never met a bad child. I've met lots of bad parents. Mr. Trump defended Russia who tampered with our voting system. Mr. Trump who never served a day in his life, said terrible things about John McCain of all people! To me that is treasonous. Donald Trump wouldn't last one week in the same situation as John McCain. And, yet fools still voted for him? EVERYONE should be outraged not just democrats but everyone. The press should be hanging all these men out to dry. I've given up on my subscription. It just doesn't feel like real reporting anymore. Republicans, democrats, men, women. Absolutely everyone should be outraged. But until "poor people rise up and take their share" men like Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions will continue to govern and hurt the meek and innocent in this country.  All I know is I can hold my head up high because I did not vote for him. I love my country and the men and women that serve.  I do not support racism.  When men like the president elect, Mr. Session, Jesse Helms or Strom Thurmond pass on all I can say is good riddance.  They will not be missed.  The senators were too easy on Sessions. Any man who says that "Trump likes women" after Trump brags about sexually assault, has no place making important decisions that affect Americans. End of story.<br/><br/>A person who makes a statement that 'boys will be boys', is THE reason the Trumps continue to assault women. Our only hope lies within the Democratic party. They are all that lies between us and the incredibly unfit cabinet that incredibly unfit President Elect Trump has chosen. Yet, here they are, our only hope, rolling over, kissing up and tossing softballs. Why is no one grilling Sessions on his separation of church and state stance? Why are Democrats so willing to believe that Sessions does not mean what he says and does not agree with groups he joins or is honored by? I am tired of this weak, useless Democratic party. It has been clear for years that the Republican party intends to lead us to a one party country and the Democrats are just clueless. I will be voting against them in mid term if they don't start to show some backbone ASAP.Fun!  Is Hillary Clinton a loser? Are liberals heads exploding?

The double standard is grotesque.actually the situation is beginning to remind me of Nam where a majority were 'love it or leave it' until the bodies came back. that I fear is  where we are at. It will be 'give him a chance" until all of his economic promises that directly affect people fail. that is when a war is started just like bush in 2003. my fear is  that conservatives will take measures to ensure a permanent reign.Republicans believe that the rules and protocols only apply to Democrats.It should now be abundantly clear to those of us who consider ourselves progressives, and even those of us who label ourselves democrats but are not progressive enough - elected democrats DO NOT represent any of us.<br/>The one chance senate dems had to grill a colleague, and they had enough ammunition, they chose to ignore the majority of voters and instead succumbed to the good ole boy network.<br/>This is getting worse by the minute. This is one of the reason why I no longer give any money to the Democrats but only to individual candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The Democratic Party have become a gaggle of fairies who are afraid of their own shadow. Sessions is a RACIST, and all they can do is dance a jig around him. This is why the Republicans win. They play dirty and all the Democrats do is say, "Oh, my!" With a limp wrist. Makes me sick.The clueless Democrats have followed the same playbook for decades, and NEVER has it worked. But they keep trying.

Then, when I was watching the replay of the people demonstrating, I saw him for what he was back then &amp; continues to be, a true son of the South. The demonstrators were screaming about the injustice felt by their grandparents, parents, &amp; other family members during the long period of segregation the African Americans had to endure. And what was the reformed senator doing, when the camera was on him, he was smiling, enjoying the unhappiness those people were feeling, for so long. He was having a good time, at their expense, sitting there in his $200 haircut &amp; well tailored suit. - "That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain"— Hamlet Act 1, ... Keep smiling Jeff, you didn't fool me for long. Think about who selected you for A. G., explain that to your grandchildren! I served in the armed forces in the late 50's &amp; I'm a proud New Yorker. It was there that I got my first inkling of what those good old boys from the south were all about. They smiled &amp; patted you on the back, at the same time spewing the worst kind of bigotry I had ever heard. My wife danced with a black shipmate, we happen to be Caucasian, &amp; the dance hall got still. I knew then that we were not in NY, we were in Washington, D.C., as far south as we had ever been. Warmest regards Senator, I'll be watching every decision you make, with interest &amp; hope.Like I said. Keep it up and you may just get a Republican Senate super majority in two years. You people just don't get it. "In 2015, Mr. Sessions received the annual Keeper of the Flame award from the Center for Security Policy, a Washington think tank that promotes anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. Its founder, Frank Gaffney, has argued, among other things, that Mr. Obama is secretly a Muslim and that the crescent in the new logo of the Missile Defense Agency is a veiled sign that the United States has submitted to Islamic law."<br/>Or perhaps because we are selling billions of dollars of military equipment to UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia?Not if we push to have Trump impeached for corruption.

I was short on tomaotoes (only 1.5 cups) so I added some tomato paste and did half white wine and half water for the liquid. I had 1 red and 1 green bell pepper and added 2 small sliced jalapenos. I served it over cauliflower rice with crusty bread and butter.

It was super yummy!I also used parsnips and yellow potatoes. Tasted delicious!Typical Yam Ottolenghi: his dishes may be great, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it because the ingredients are impossible to find.Despite the claims from some that this isn&#x27;t a &quot;classic&quot; recipe for this or that reason, this is a very nice bread. My recipe differs slightly in a couple of ways, but that&#x27;s what makes cooking a joy for me. I don&#x27;t have to follow anyone else&#x27;s style, I can create my own. I use the cornstarch in water brushing because I sprinkle a heavy covering of lightly toasted caraway seeds on my loaves - for the flavor and the delightful crunch,A great alternative to cream is silken tofu, blended.

BDS,<br/><br/>This story had been floating around the media for months and David Corn wrote about it, though far more responsibly than either CNN or BuzzFeed, but everyone in the media, including the Times had copies of the same 35 pages BuzzFeed put out. In its own statement, the Times stated that they had not seen fit to print this news as they could not verify it. The Clinton campaign and the #NeverTrump movement commissioned this report. Had they felt confident about its veracity, it is logical that they would have been first to use it in late summer. They didn't, and with good reason. The fallout from using it would have garnered significant backlash. <br/><br/>There is a time and place to act. This showed very poor judgment by CNN and BuzzFeed.I'm so tired of Trump using the "audit excuse" as his rationale for not releasing his tax returns for public inspection.  First off, we have nothing apart from his accountant's statement to confirm that any of his returns are being audited by the IRS. Secondly, assuming that they ARE being audited, this surely doesn't involve his entire history of tax filing...? Why not release the rest of his returns?  And how long has this process been going on now?  Months? Years?  Decades?  Third, even if they are being audited (all of them!), he is under no legal obligation to withhold them from pubic review.  None.  And anyone who believes that our new kitty-grabber-in-chief has nothing to hide with respect to business dealings with Russia (among other less-than-friendly states), non-payment of federal income tax, paltry contributions to charity and/or the claiming of dependents other than his wife and the one minor child we're presently aware of is remarkably credulous.  At the same time, anyone who suspects that something may be up with this imaginary object of Putin's admiration but simply doesn't much care will be waiting almost as long for jobs to return to the Rust Belt as for Jesus to reappear in Jerusalem.        Though I'm from Singapore, where the legal drinking age for all types of alcohol is 18, I completely agree with the author's standpoint. Suddenly allowing 18 year olds to purchase alcohol does no good in emphasising the importance of knowing one's limits, since it creates an atmosphere where drinking is viewed as being a coming of age rite (and thus the number of young adults who end up vomiting curbside at 2am). Rather, countries should adopt the German policy of allowing 16 year olds to purchase drinks with low alcohol content and hard liquors at 18. This might be more effective in teaching them the importance of knowing their limits and that there is nothing especially 'cool' about drinking culture. Given Mr. Trump's history of sexually inappropriate behavior, and apparent contempt for President Obama, I wouldn't be altogether surprised if a prostitue-harem-golden-shower-Obama-bed-defiling story turns out to be true, as ridiculous as it sounds.  If untrue, perhaps the birther of the birther lie could benefit from tasting his own medicine.  Though I guess this is of lesser importance compared to other artifacts in the dossier. I think there is a chance to do this. If the politics can be worked out.  The way to do it is to allow ad hoc groups to get insurance, and to allow those groups to have insurance across state lines. <br/><br/>I own a business with 25 employees spread over 5 states. Getting health insurance in multiple states is hard and expensive. If we could get insurance through our industry trade group, we would be part of a 10,000 person pool, we'd get much better insurance at better prices. But, today, that's illegal. Only unions can have insurance across state lines. <br/><br/>Besides an industry trade group, what if an individual could get that health insurance as part of being members of a club, a church, an association, or AARP?  Now, you have some negotiating power.  Insurance companies would be courting every organization for business.  Anyone can join. Its a win-winI am glad to see that they are committed to such an important objective.I can still remember Graham's comparison of a navel orange to a different feminine body part "most like mother herself" as I watched his show with my grandmother, the best cook I ever knew. She was scandalized and couldn't stop laughing all afternoon. Thanks to him, I have always thought of cooking as an adventure I wanted to be part of and by making dishes from all over the world, I managed to find understanding of other people and their cultures. Whereas I usually found Julia Child's techniques off-putting, Graham's preparation skills and amusing approach to cooking were easy for me to emulate and imitate as I grew in confidence in the kitchen.There is ALWAYS something We the People can do.<br/>That's what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution have proven.<br/><br/>We the People found King George's rule tyrannical.<br/>We the People declared ourselves free of it.<br/>We the People gave ourselves our independence.<br/><br/>We the People can declare a corrupted election - and vote again.<br/>SCOTUS, if you're listening... this Citizen petitions you publicly to intervene and undo the evil that you did in 2000.

As one such individual, I wish Trump et al. might switch some views (trade, probably most of all) but will generally be good for the economy. Well, yes. Since climatologists and meteorologists do not make accurate predictions about the future--we should disparage them as well. Heck, medical doctors misdiagnose all the time. Let's get rid of the whole bunch --economists, physicians, weather folks. Or at least force them to enter a Maoist reeducation camp so they can reflect on their chronic persistence in an uncertain world. And once they feel bad enough about themselves, won't that make you feel better, db?Small businesses have always failed at an alarming rate--especially within 12 mos. The reasons almost always have to do with the nature of the business and the business owner(s). Until you factor that reality into your analysis, the argument about regulations (good or bad) has no useful context.Trump has been such a nasty piece of work, always lying, making up stories about other people, threatening to jail an opponent, calling hardworking people clowns and losers, refusing to pay contractors by pretending their work wasn't good enough, ogling teenage girls, assaulting women and on and on.<br/>Can we really not believe he's in cahoots with Putin, can we really not believe there are video tapes of him committing adultery while his wife is penned up in Trump Tower, when everything else about this man has been vile and disgusting?50% of black women chose not to vote.  In effect they elected Trump as much as white women did.  It is not surprising the overwhelming black vote Hillary got- she constantly pandered to blacks while excluded 87% of America.  She trotted around with Michael Brown's mother and a dozen other black women who'd lost children to gun violence by whites.  2% of all violence in white on black.  70% of all interracial violence has a black perpetrator.  But she chose to exclude the mother's who were not black and whose killer wasn't white.  Not one of these deaths were any more tragic then gun violence that happens everyday, and in several cases (such as Brown) the culpability rests solely with the criminal actions of the deceased person.  Why does the mother of a black male who robbed then brutually assaulted an elderly Asian clerk then tried to kill a cop get put on a pedestal?  It's offensive and racist.  If Brown were Asian and that store clerk a Somalian immigrant his mom would not be touted by the Democrats.<br/>Blacks seem to think the fact that most blacks voted for Hillary means they used better judgement.  No, they voted for who catered to their unreasonable demands 24/7.  If it had been Trump they would have voted Trump.BuzzFeed was as justified in publishing its unverified report as Comey was in publicly speculating about the unverified—and unfounded—Weiner emails. It's just too bad that BuzzFeed didn't publicize its report before the election, if only to witness the kind of hissy-fit that only the trumpster can throw. He might have even imploded. All that orange flesh and fake blond hair floating around; I'd have paid good money to see that!Like president elect Trump or dislike him but this type of journalism is beginning to undermine the smooth transfer of power in the United States of America.  Is the documented information regarding Donald Trump such that we need to recklessly pile on innuendo and hearsay in the days leading up to his inauguration because the public needs to know while we still have time?   If we agree that these are real questions that need answers then it should be verified information leading to questions of then president Trump.   However if this is a thinly veiled attempt to nullify or make illegitimate a democratically held election in our country than we are in danger of the boy who cried wolf trap.   What if a more concerted effort was put in place to subvert our democracy?  Who could you believe after this tabloid like chasing of anything negative regarding Trump.  Standards for journalism exist for a reason and it's sad to see them thrown away for a short sighted hissyfit over an election between 2 candidates that had real flaws.  Reasonable people could have chosen one or the other.  In this difficult world, everyone knows about Russia's misdeeds, particularly its lust for grabbing power wherever it can. The respect to rule of law and societal values in the American society are definitely absent in Russia. The present news scandal gets the color of truth, as there is a continuous refusal to blame Russia for interfering with US Democracy. This point has to be seriously noted.<br/>There seems to be a war of words between present and future 'tenses' - as between tackling the email hacking issue (the present tense) is confused with the US-Russia relations (the future tense). So, first thing first. We have to first solve the issue of unfair Russian Aggression or rather intervention in US Democracy, i.e. tackling the issue at hand.Cookies are yummy.

Not sure why the recipe calls for simmering for 50 minutes; even with &quot;roughly&quot; chopped carrots and parsnip, 20 minutes is more than enough for the vegetables to get super tender. Add spices and herbs for more complexity of flavor.see step 1Very interesting article. I wish Mr. Obama had discussed this more often.<br/><br/>Automation and its opportunities and negatives have been around a long time.  I got into this topic in the 80s during the Reagan double-dip recessions.  It was a pretty rough time for the economy and those who were in policy jobs were searching for pathway solutions.  I met with Wassily Leontief, whose name came to my attention through his article in Scientific American on the distribution of incomes and jobs.  It was a well researched article and bottom line he suggested that as automation soaked up traditional jobs, it would be a good idea to cut the work week and free workers for more leisure activities &amp; to pursue personal entrepreneurial activities.  He showed me in his input-output tables that this change, if managed properly, would improve the distribution of incomes &amp; jobs &amp; create more pleasure.<br/><br/>2nd thought: Electricity is fundamental to automation and eventually because of population growth, finite limits to fossil fuels including the challenges of global warming that eventually we will need to build a system of space solar satellites to beam power to Earth grids.  My colleague, Dr, James Powell, has authored a book, "Silent Earth", that describes this space solar satellite system that will deliver very cheap electric power to all of the Earth's people to power our needs for a modern standard of living.  The energy efficiency should unleash the economic forces that will increase prosperity.O Frabjous Friday.

Why are comments with the A-word rejected?I sure exceptions will be made for those likely (or certain) to be persecuted on their return. In the 1980's, I hosted Cuban dissident Reinaldo Arenas in my Lawrence apartment for 45 minutes, just the two of us chatting one-on-one about being gay here in the US versus there on the island. What he told me was riveting and depressing, even as it was clear he was thrilled to be in a country that was well on the way to ending all legal prosecution and social stigmatism of gays and lesbians. We must continue to alllow people, regardless of their feet's wetness/dryness, to stay if they are likely to be presecuted on their return.But it's Ok for Mexicans?Trump does not hate immigrants.  He is married to one.  He just believes we should enforce our laws.  Illegal immigrants are overwhelming our social services!Bravo.  I couldn't agree more.Haiti and Honduras are more dangerous and oppressive than Cuba. Wow.....<br/>To appease a dictator, Obama is willing to close the doors to refugees from an oppressive regime.

I doubt I was the only one.  It makes sense and would put Carson in the field he is a qualified expert in.<br/>Instead, Trump names Carson to be Secretary of HUD because he grew up in a poor black urban neighborhood decades ago. (I assume, it's the only logical explanation.)<br/> Doesn't seem to be a case of putting the best person in the best position.Obviously they just haven't been quoted on TV yet.  Trump doesn't really read things, so he hasn't noticed any of this so far.This is a Saturday? I'll not say how fast I completed this. It'd be in poor taste."Republicans in Congress would probably eliminate rules that require a minimum package of benefits for all insurance plans and allow states to determine what insurers would have to include. Mr. Trump has said he’d like to encourage the sale of insurance across state lines, a policy likely to make coverage more skimpy but less expensive for many customers. Republicans would also like to expand tax incentives for people to save money for health expenses."<br/><br/>The scam of cheap heath care insurance was always peace of mind at a cheap rate until the insured actually needed health care. Then, rooms filled with agents employed to find reasons to deny coverage went to work and those who thought they had cheap coverage found out they had very little or no coverage at all. Obama attempted to fix this as Hillary Clinton had attempted many years before. It seems to be too complex for the average American to understand and therefore easy to politicize. Obama and the Democrats have always been too intellectual for half of the country...hate is so much easier to wrap your brain around.Ben Carson is not merely the worst possible lobbyist for fighting racist housing policies.  He's a champion of diversity only in that he serves as a bad example in a surprisingly diverse number of areas.<br/><br/>The list of things he gets wrong is astounding.  He believes that being gay is a choice, because straight convicts who are raped in prison come out gay.  Evolution is devil talk.  The Big Bang is a fairy tale. Global warming doesn’t exist.  There is no racism: black people get no respect due to lack of education.  Planned Parenthood is a conspiracy to kill black babies.<br/><br/>This is the man who tried to acquire some gritty street cred by claiming he tried to stab a childhood friend to death, and who survived only due to a large belt buckle.  The lack of evidence for such an attack made him angry, because no one would believe that he was homicidal.<br/><br/>During a holdup at a Popeye’s, he says he told the gunman, “I believe you want the guy behind the counter.”  In a way, I guess that was helpful.<br/><br/>If anyone is expecting Ben Carson to speak coherently about the plight of poor African American people in public housing, they will have a long wait.  The wait will be even longer when every other cabinet appointment of the incoming ego-in-chief makes similar outrageous statements.  It appears that every member of the Cabinet of the Deplorables is especially ignorant in their areas of responsibility.<br/><br/>At least color will not matter in the new world order.

I realize the feminist movement was a self congratulating union that still wants to monopolize the conversation. Whatever they've done they've done - call it victory and go home. I think it better that today's kids live their feminism than use history didactically.  I endorse this nit. Trump is obviously either clueless, oblivious or both. Otherwise, before the election he would have consulted with health care experts and had a potentially workable plan in place. Instead, he just wants to let Congress decide. Well, if the result is "Ryan care" maybe Trump will actually listen to what the actuaries in the CBO have to say about a large increase to the national debt and no funding mechanism for whatever the federal government decides will be its contribution to the pot. Then again, so far he hasn't signaled an inclination to fight the most conservative  elements of his party despite his campaign rhetoric. Jan. 21st. women's march.The idea that this will be a country of robot repairmen or perpetual job retainers is as ludicrous as the idea that we would become a nation of white collar professionals (a dream pushed by pro-NAFTA politicians in the late 1980s and early 1990s). <br/><br/>I don't know what is going to happen. I never looked at it, but if someone told me that 95% of jobs in 1880 are now gone I would not be surprised. So we simply don't know what would happen. But what I do know is that we will never have a nation of "STEM graduates" who all make tons of money and are secure in the new economy. It's a fantasy. Nor can we reasonably expect people to constant retrain after the stuff they already trained for gets automated in 3 years. BB- thank you.  You stated exactly why, after four mammograms, I decided never again.  It's an unpleasant exchange with my doctor now as she becomes increasingly insistent that I need to have mammograms, and I remind her it is my choice, and I choose not to have my healthy tissue crushed and subject to radiation.  I am certain there have been no studies into whether mammography might trigger or contribute to cancer--who would fund such a venture?  But I remember the sick feeling deep in my skin for weeks after my last mammogram.  It would help if news media followed the (usual though not invariable) practice of the New York Times by reporting not only on what happened but making clear how we know.<br/>For instance:  Here's a real argument.  One person said "Clinton got more popular votes than Trump, by close to 3 million" and the other said, "No, that's not true, Trump won the popular vote."  Neither could cite anything besides a news report they recalled.  So, instead of just repeating that 2.8 million popular vote lead each time, can't reporters, and even columnists, explain that the popular vote kept getting counted as mail ballots came in and provisional ballots were evaluated, that official state websites posted final totals, and that the final totals based on these can be found at the Cook report -- and that you personally can check these results against official state sites?<br/>That's one example.  Yes, it's important to speak truth to power.  But it's also important to model for your audience how truth is established on the basis of evidence."The Police" constitute a gray fuzzy area-- separate culture.  If they do something wrong, who do you call?  Why the police, of course!  As a separate culture, "The Police" are not subject to the same sort of accountability to "law and order" as are the government and the governed.  They are a presence that is always in the dark, never fully knowable.  Trampling on Civil Rights is what the French call, 'bavure.'  Coming from the verb to dribble or drool-- something that can't be helped if one wishes to eat.  Police brutality is a result of creating a Police Culture.  As long as the Police Culture exists (and nobody is talking about putting and end to Police Culture), there will be bavure.  A few dribbles on the tie, in the course of a meal is to be expected, unless of course, you are the tie.It's free market politics. We are a capitalist country and so the capitalists rule. The rest of us live off of their scraps and diminishing social consciousness.This is what happens when you pass game changing legislation without compromise, reading the legislation, and changing the rules in the Senate. You can that Harry Reid for this. Obama has no one to thank except himself for listening to the bad advice of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. And if your conjecture is true, and I hope it is for "health care sake", the Dems, placid as ever,  will sit back and let it happen. Somehow they need to grow a backbone.The Buzzfeed report is not the first news article to be attacked by Trump, it is his way of operating, he  has a long record of suing  those whom write critical articles about him. <br/><br/>Even though a public person is subject to different interpretation of  libel laws than the the ordinary person, he has his attorneys sue for large sums, the cost of defending is beyond that of many writers. This intimidates the press and the free dissemination of news about him. It is not much different than the Fascist parties techniques of the 1930s, shut down the news that you do not like, and the misdeeds, corruption, criminal behavior of the politicians is hidden from the public.<br/><br/>Trump is a master of this, and the news organizations are allowing him to get away with it, it is a blot on their duty to keep the public informed. As we saw, there was very little investigative journalism about Trump, but almost daily article about Clinton. Trump was whitewashed by the press, a disservice to us all. <br/><br/>We are now being subjected to daily tirades attacking any negative news about him, and worse yet a congressman proposed that CNN fire a reporter for "Disrespecting Trump." The very core of Fascist dictatorship practices. Suddenly the dictator can not be criticized, he can not be held accountable for his actions, this is not the country is was raised in it the one we fought in WWII.

That doesn't mean that most people can.<br/><br/>I salute Ben Carson for having made it out of poverty.  But the gate he came through was -- and still is -- too narrow for every poor Black person to make it through.Obama's big mistake, and frankly many of the Dems over the years was to make ACA etc., about reform, and somewhat about access, as opposed to a moral right.  And while I think Obama's farewell speech gave us a lot to ponder as Trump takes over, it was a missed opportunity to assert that among the many rights we have as Americans, health is one of them.Donald Trump could do something right now to assuage some of the concerns about the forthcoming presidency: demand that GOP leaders spell out exactly how they intend to replace Obamacare. He promised his supporters, many of whom are on the ACA, to replace the program with something cheaper and covering everyone. He famously said during the campaign: " We can't have people dying in the streets."<br/><br/>Mr Trump, don't settle for repeal now and " we'll get to it later." If you can imagine winning a second term, you better get this one right.“The public has rendered judgment,” Mr. Shimkus said.“ The public did indeed speak Mr. Shimkus and fellow Republicans. By almost 3 million votes the public voted to change, but not repeal the ACA. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the Senate and House seem to have trouble with recognizing that. Cognitive dissonance perhaps? Does their elite health care policy provides mental health coverage? Get the goat out of the house? Really!! The only goat doing damage in this case is the Republican majority in the house and senate. Imagine if Clinton had been the beneficiary of Chinese hacking of the RNC? Imagine if Hillary had not released her tax returns? Imagine if Hillary had won the electoral college but lost the popular vote? Imagine if Hillary turned over a vast business empire to Chelsea and tried to say that was adequate and without conflict of interest. Can anyone really believe that Republicans wouldn't be calling her a corrupt traitor? Republicans said "Lock Her Up" over emails that did absolutely nothing and were of no real value because, realistically, they would have been leaked by either the Republicans or Comey's FBI NY office. But if the hacking of Democrats and a few Republicans by Russians is no big deal to Republicans, why did they get so upset over an email server in Clinton's home in the first place? This is the definition of hypocrisy isn't it. Comey talking about emails again right before the election while knowing this stuff about Trump and Co. and the Russian hacking was out there but remained silent. The sad fact here is that there is a code of ethics for everyone but Republicans and Trump in particular. People may forget he is the first Presidential candidate of any party since Nixon not to release their tax return. He says he is still under audit - I say he is lying to the American people. If he had nothing to hide he could increase his credibility just by doing so. The lack of transparency is a de facto admission of guilt and the only question is, of what? Treason anyone?On the perhaps presumptuous belief that this piece isn’t ONLY meant for the NYT’s black readership, I’m going to gingerly stick a white toe in the water.<br/><br/>At the very beginning, a lot of US feared for Barack Obama’s life, as well. This is, after all, Amurka. But then came ObamaCare, and the concern shifted to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. (Well, to be honest, it wasn’t TOO much concern.)<br/><br/>Greatest black man in American history? A case certainly can made for EITHER Martin Luther King OR Barack Obama, but how about Frederick Douglass? I mean, it’s not like the man had ANY help from a minimally sympathetic national audience, like King and Obama did. The mountain HE had to climb to be effective REALLY earns him a place on a Mt. Rushmore, v.2., before ANYONE else is considered.<br/><br/>Presuming to speak for the oddly absent aging, a bit overweight and diffident white guy population in this piece, almost all of us ALSO are exceedingly happy that Barack Obama made it through alive. And, in the end, while Nancy and Harry also made it through, they seem to have gotten their just deserts anyway.It is necessary for institutions to change for African-Americans to have more of a chance to attain successes.  Conservatives have always claimed that first we must change the hearts of the bigots, and then they will change the institutions naturally.  In other words, let's not rush things.<br/><br/>States as we speak are drafting even more laws to suppress the minority vote.  How about changing that?  Health care is about to be yanked out of the lives of the poor, including minorities.  How about that institution?  Taxpayer support of education is shrinking.  Trump wants to use stop and frisk/racial profiling and says that protestors of excessive force are terrorists.  Yes, let's wait for conservatives' hearts to change as they see Black people succeed.  A very old and brutal con.  Really, I think we are over complicating this. Trump looks out for Trump. First, always. If he isn't already entwined with Russia through business deals, he plans to become so after his presidency--if not before by using his children. He knows there is money to be made there, and nothing else, including our country's interests, doesn't become part of the calculus.Rima:<br/><br/>"I never apologize for not knowing something about myself. I’m sorry, that’s just the way I am."<br/><br/>Richard Luettgen - The New York Times Commentariat (2017) (mildly channeling Homer J. Simpson)<br/><br/>"I used to have an open mind, but my brains kept falling out."<br/><br/>KaceyThe people clearly did not elect him because of his ways with women.<br/><br/>So the answer is fairly simple, if the films were actually made:<br/><br/>Do what Sukarno of Indonesia did when the Soviets made many erotic videos of him with every kind of Russian women.<br/><br/>Trump should demand a high quality, master copy of each episode and distribute them for rent or sell in his world wide hotels, for a  Netflix series, and for sale in adult video stories thru out the red states. <br/><br/>He can triumphantly do what Sukarno did and proclaim himself father of the developing world and lover of whatever wild Russian women he could meet.<br/><br/>The Russians caved in and made all the copies Sukarno demanded--which were distributed free to theaters thruout Indonesia; and Sukarno was respected and reelected in a landslide. Our founding fathers were every bit as ruthless as Trump and got a lot done, along with a lot of mistakes. <br/><br/>Let us demand the same for our king for four years. If he does not achieve a lot and fails to ignite the rebuilding of America, let us execute him. For losing would be his death. <br/><br/>John F Kennedy has a much richer sexual history as president, in bed with a mafia princess, and many others, than Trump has even been rumored to have. Let Trump not have this little tempest as an excuse for not rebuilding our infrastructure, research, development, and industries.The Republican party needs to be careful how they handle this situation or they run the risk of being tainted by it.  Between 9/11 which was caused by the inattention of the Republican president, the financial crisis also under a Republican president, the lowest approval rating in history of a non productive, largely Republican Congress for the last six years Americans are running out of patience.  If anything happens because the Republican party chooses not to look into the possibility that Trump is beholden to the Russians, Democrats will be able to use it against them for a generation.  This has the potential to blow up in their face and they need to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Country before party.  We don't need another Nixon.Agree strongly.  And look at his behavior over the past several months.  Is there anything he has said or done that indicates he sees the presidency as serving the American people?   I think he does not - he sees opportunities to further inflate his ego and bank accounts, and punish anyone who doesn't like him. How could he possibly function as president if he contradicts himself from one day to the next, displays astonishing ignorance of national and international issues, and appoints unqualified people to his Cabinet? Even with the concerns about Russia, Trump is not competent to be president.Still wondering about FUTURE PERFECT for Utopia.  Utopia is an imagined place or state of affairs where everything is perfect.  It is not a perfect society yet to come.  In fact, I think the basic concept of utopia is its non-existence, its inability to exist in reality.  In fact, utopia derives from the Greek meaning "no place."Yes, Mr. Kristof, good points throughout. But you left out two points of crucial  importance. First, the most explosive charge comes today from the British newspaper, The Independent. They claim that Christopher Steele concluded that there was a cabal within the FBI that was intentionally blocking investigation of Trump's collusion with Russia, insisting instead on investigating Hillary's emails. The Independent claims that Steele was so alarmed by this that after the election he was working for free, desperately trying to alert the other intelligence agencies to the danger. Needless to say, this is deeply disturbing, suggesting as it does institutional corruption going even beyond Trump.<br/><br/>Second, as for the dossier, it is not quite right to assert that there is "zero public evidence behind it." As the Guardian has pointed out, the report is written chronologically and makes a number of substantive predictions that turn out to be correct. For example, it warns about Carter Page's involvement with the Russians, an issue that became known publicly only several months later. (Note that Trump at his most recent press conference denied even knowing Page, one of his senior advisers on Russia. Why?) More importantly the dossier correctly predicted that Trump would favor giving Putin a pass on Crimea and urge a critical attitude toward NATO--all before he made any public pronouncements on these issues. This is partial verification of the report and good reason to take it seriously.It is essential that we get this right. With the information that is public there is no informed concensus to be had. But either way, we need to know the whole story.  Questions already asked need to be answered and answered clearly.<br/>Are our intelligence agencies colluding to undermine the president elect? Has Mr. Trump been compromised and what is the entirety of his relationships with Russian entities, including the Kremlin? Are Comey's actions defensible in several matters, to include his refusal to make public this evidence earlier.<br/>Is there a rogue element within our national security apparatus?<br/>A full telling is due.Trump hates ordinary people and is determined to return the country to the control of industry.   Sad.   There are a lot more ordinary people than there are industrialists, however.  Eventually this will turn out badly for Trump.  Hopefully the ordinary people of the US will not be damaged too badly.  Why does Trump hate us so much?    Dagwood:<br/><br/>Economic class integration is not a brutal con: it's the only real way we'll ever solve race as a problem in America. Institutions obey the dictates of those currently in power, as you so conveniently admit yourself, making my point FOR me.Even if we give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt, that he is not beholden in some way to Vladimir Putin, his bromance with the Russian strongman still is alarming.  It betrays a profound naivety about history and a willingness to cozy up to a ruthless dictator whose chief foreign policy goal is to undermine liberal democracies.  As Russian dissident Gary Kasparov has pointed out, it is rather odd that Trump has flip-flopped on virtually issue except for his defense of Russia and its leader.  Now, more than ever before, Trump needs to release his tax returns to help demonstrate that he has no financial ties to Russia.  He should not be able to hide behind the bogus shield of an IRS audit any longer.  Maybe it’s time for Senator Shumer to step into the breach and do something about the TransHudson Tunnels and the Northeastern rail corridor.  Trump might like it just for building up his ego about building near home.<br/><br/>But it’s also relatively cheap as compared to a national repair everything at once.  Trump might be a little appreciation in his inner circles for that. For a mere $100  billion, they could contract the entire line from Washington to Boston and a bit beyond. <br/><br/>That would replace the old bridges, straight lines, add new equipment. The region most important to the Trump companies would benefit directly - and no one could complain. <br/><br/>The funds could also be provided for the alternate high speed line from NYC to Boston right of way acquisition - and it wouldn’t hurt to correct the problem of trackage from Boston to Albany and Points West. <br/><br/>Wisconsin could be led to reconsider the new high speed line killed by Scott Walker and run it through Madison with regular service to Milwaukee. <br/><br/>But what is more likely is that Texas and Alabama and point that don’t really carry their weight will drain off too much of the “investment” to take care of Trump buddies.stu:<br/><br/>I rarely disguise my contempt for those who disagree with me. But I'm a cheap thrill -- I'm not president, VERY likely never will be, and just as unlikely to be charged with "transforming" anything (even you).I'm trying to remember if Mr. Trump has been so unrelentingly positive about anyone else. He's said positive things about his family of course. And some of the people working in his campaign got the occasional shout-out. His cabinet appointees, random people at rallies, even President Obama have been mentioned. But no one else has gotten the continuous glowing praise that Putin has. That would be unusual coming from anyone. But Trump? The only other person he praises so highly, is himself.<br/><br/>I think the Russians keep pretty close tabs on any visiting Americans. Trump, a high profile businessman running a pageant, would have created some interest. It's not hard to imagine they could have lots of material on Trump. No matter what he says now, do you really think he would have been concerned there might be cameras in his rooms? And his cell phone would have been an open book. Nothing would have escaped their notice.<br/><br/>None of that means Trump did anything worthy of blackmail. But it's possible.<br/>Now Trump seems to be arranging a visit with Putin. That's his priority? So much going on here, and that's one of the first things on his list.<br/>I think there's a lot he needs to make clear to the American people. He is no longer the private businessman who can keep keep his connections private.Thomas:<br/><br/>Come on. David is NEVER right. About anything.It's incredibly suspicious that Trump goes out of his way to praise Putin, ignores his gangsterism, downplays his anti democratic actions in Russia, denies his illegal aggression against Ukraine, and excuses war crimes in Syria. <br/><br/>Trump only fans suspicion about his motives when he insists on waging an open war on US intelligence agencies. He doesn't seem to realize (or care?) that he's weakening an essential element of national security.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's exactly what you'd expect if he wanted to discredit an otherwise unimpeachable source likely to confirm his misdeeds. And Donald knows what a bad boy he's been over the years. My guess? We've heard only a small fraction of his depravities, transgressions, and dirty business dealings. And nothing yet that explains his obligations to Putin.<br/><br/>However, unlike rogue elements of the FBI out to get HRC without justification, disgruntled intelligence agencies here and abroad may have no choice but to find damaging information on Trump and quietly make it available to congress and the media. This is absolutely necessary if the PEOTUS threatens the safety and security of the US and its allies.david:<br/><br/>Never suggested that workers have less rights than bond holders. It was Barack Obama who acted on the assumption of the reverse.Agreed, on the partial verification already. Take a look at Malcolm Nance's views on t rump and the Russians. He looks at the circumstances like a spy would, not a journalist, since he works in the intelligence community. He said there is evidence to substantiate the claims all over the place, from personnel, to contacts, to t rump's statements timed with the Wikileaks exposures.Donald trump saying that president Obama was born "abroad" was a LIE not an unsubstantiated rumor.  A vile, racist lie that was the foundations of his appeal.  Trump is now being accused of substantiated, though not fully verified allegations. The sex stuff is the least important - possibly embarrassing but a private matter as far as I'm concerned. It's the financial dealings that are relevant and the allegations have merit. All signs indicate trump and his people have Russian ties, do lucrative business on Russia and can easily be bought.  I count on journalists of your caliber to accurately and aggressively report and stop giving trump so much misguided and unearned deference - the likes of which tips same paper rarely afforded his opponent.Democrats "have little credibility"?  That's crazy talk.  Democrats consistently beat Republicans in fact checking.  It's only the twisting of those facts by people like you who have made Americans believe that the falsehood that Democrats are credible.  Are you regretting that yet?  Defense contracts increasingly go to make political payoffs to relatively poor Red States where plants provide campaign fodder and claims of prosperity for the future. <br/><br/>Look at Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  Poor before, poor now. Alabama as a state has many advantages, good government and good public officials are, however, non existent. A huge defense operation on the old Brookley Field site in Mobile pulls in big contracts, but the region is as poor as it ever was. <br/><br/>One sign, the taxes are all skewed to hit the lower income. Near that Mobile site, sales taxes are 10 percent, tax rate for low income is the same as those at the absolute top. <br/><br/>Create housing by filling in the Bay or the water around Manhattan?<br/><br/>It would appear the biggest problem in San Francisco is the commuters from Silicon Valley with real money, who want to living. FWIW, looking around the country, the Bay area and the NYC metropolitan area are doing very well.<br/><br/>They’re being tapped along with other Northeast Corridor taxpayers and other developed states for tax money to keep the Red States solvent. It’s tiresome to see federal money go to Red States that just waste it.Mr Tillerson represents 500 billion dollar oil drilling rights in Russia that are blocked by American economic sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the Ukraine. These facts are well known yet the author characterises Mr Tillerson as only 'the friendliest' towards Russia when there is obvious quid pro quo about to be played here. Russia can invade sovereign nations at will ignoring international law because Exxon Mobil needs to provide profits for its shareholders?. Talk about prostituting our value of standing up to dictators and the rule of international law. PEOTUS Trump already says if they are helping us why should there be sanctions? We are about to renew cooperation with a man that leads his nation to annex/ invade territory - killing civilians, bomb civilians in Alleppo, and steals information from American entities worse than Nixon operatives did at watergate - at least Nixon was American. The press needs to stop kid glovin this administration.I started learning to cook in the early 1990's and Graham Kerr was the perfect teacher for helping me learn the language of cooking.  In addition to showing me how to correctly use a knife thereby eliminating the cuts that occurred whenever I attempted to slice a carrot or dice a potato.  He also introduced me to the language of the kitchen and it was from him I learned what folding meant when mixing ingredients.  He also introduced me to "exotic" things like red bell peppers lol and oyster sauce as well as the wonders of fresh herbs and freshly ground spices.  Thanks to Mr. Kerr's guidance I discovered a real love for cooking and feeding the people I love and I ultimately ended up going to Culinary School.  Thank you Chef Kerr for all your wonderful programs and especially for introducing me to the MiniMax way of cooking when I was making my first tentative forays into the world of food.    As a child I always counted "one, two, three... six!" And now I suppose I should change all my passwords. (Just kidding.)I have a chilling thought.  If China (God forbid!)  succumbed  to  air pollution, drought and desertification caused by man made temperature increase, yea, even if that happened  Trump and his friends would dismiss it as a fantasy or a scam, or even worse  a condition brought about entirely by nature.<br/><br/>I am not making a case for climate alarmism (I am a lukewarmist)  but I am worried that total irrationality may overcome  any reasonable steps  we can take to do something about CO2 overload  without destroying the economy.<br/><br/>Total irrational denial of fact, is clearly not the course to follow. The Chinese should adopt all western toilet as we Americans are mostly too<br/>big and heavy to squat. Otherwise it is not civilized. As we set international<br/>rules (even though we may not follow them) and standards globally, and<br/>they should listen!I just returned from a month of traveling in India.  The air, both urban and rural is disgusting, evening in Darjeeling in the Himalayan Foothills.  I kept thinking that this is indeed what Mr. trump wants for us.  I am convinced of it.  First, I was a business owner in China, for 15 years, and I learned many things about the distribution of wealth there. This article is absolutely true. I would go farther and say that the rising discontent is even larger than the writer says. I watched first hand the disparaging difference between those that have vs those that don't rise to a vast shrieking proportion both on the social media sites and in demonstrations across China, and importantly in Beijing.<br/>Chinese citizens are right to ask why and how does President Xi's daughter attend Harvard and how does he pay the tuition costs, which is more than they will ever earn in their entire lifetime and is wholly at odds with his anti corruption campaign.<br/>There is no equality in China and never has been. It was easy to sell the communist revolution to the Chinese, in 1949. Today, much less so. Nobody believes that nonsense any longer. Control is greater than ever to insure the party's continuation.<br/>Distribution of wealth is a global issue. The one percent gets richer and the rest get screwed. Trump with his totally failed concepts of trickle down economics and cabinet of billionaires is just the same horse with a different color. It's never worked but some Americans keep falling for the promises. The Affordable Care Act, with its imperfections, was a small attempt at leveling the a corner of playing field. The companies have seen to its demise because they have lost capital gains since ACA's inception. My suspicion is that any government, if left alone long enough, would eventually devolve to feature oligarchs or aristocrats with immense power and wealth. Perhaps it is in our DNA, but we need government policies to correct our evil predilections.@MS<br/>How do you see that occurring, one day Xi daughter who attended Harvard says “Look,Dad why don’t we be just like the good old USA?”<br/>China is in a constant state of change, has been for decades but the CCP is unified by Leninist principles and is full of people who have been all over the world and know it well. Look for change occurring within the party as it appears now to be doing; likely not to your liking. China knows its wining a large role and has no regrets. Jason.<br/>I have been following Reagan's comments and he certainly is better informed than your average reader.<br/>I don't know why people don't understand that both Republicans and Democrats share a common ideology. The Soviet Union had its liberals and conservatives but they were both Communists. The USA has both liberals and conservatives and both believe in the wisdom of the free market and the absolute authority of the private sector.<br/>When Reagan became president the search for the proper balance was lost. America's search for a more perfect union was over .<br/>There is a conference in Budapest in September called Degrowth.<br/>Degrowth is a movement in search of balance. I don't know why anyone who claims intelligence would belong to cult that believes in perpetual growth and mock people who believe in a deity.<br/>Reagan understandably believes the USA has fallen over the cliff and certainly with President Trump the USA will be seen as another failed nation state.<br/>I don't understand why not believing Trump will be a capable President means you join a cult that believes in the same need for perpetual economic growth.<br/>We have more than enough for everybody what we need is some kind of balance where everybody has enough. I do not aspire to great wealth and I do not begrudge great wealth but  there is something wrong when the richest most powerful nation that ever was  declares that way too much is still  not enough.The problem isn't robots doing the work.  The problem is who owns the robots.While this is a clever suggestion, it reflects a rather outdated image of what a "robot" looks like.  Take IBM's Watson.  It's already engaged in activities like assisting with medical diagnoses.  There's no identifiable person being displaced for whom FICA and Medicare taxes could be assessed.  In the long run there may be less need for physicians' assistants, or even for some physicians themselves, but there won't be any one-for-one exchange of a person for a robot.<br/><br/>Yes there will be some androids who take the place of people, but that will be a small proportion of the workers displaced by advances in information technology.  Look at the example in the photograph where restaurant wait-staff are being replaced by tablets and self-service.  A lot of automation transfers work that used to be performed by employees onto customers. Online travel companies like Travelocity reduce the need for travel agents. These developments often provide customers with benefits like the ability to shop for airfares and hotel accommodations from a broad array of choices.  But it would be difficult if not impossible to calculate the amount of lost payroll tax income from the reduction in the number of travel agents, nor determine how much Expedia should pay to cover that lost revenue.Ron,<br/><br/>Good post.<br/><br/>I have come to believe that most swing voters actually lean Republican, and that Democratic leaning voters tend to be more homogenous - rejecting anyone who disagrees with them on any issue.<br/><br/>I lean towards traditional Democratic positions on most issues, with some exceptions.  But when I disagree with Democrats on any single issue - particularly wedge issues - I get very extreme reactions.  Democrats do not want a big tent.  Republican leaning voters are a more diverse coalition, so they are more used to listening and compromising.<br/><br/>The issues that Democrats *do* seem willing to compromise on, are economic inequality, and corruption.  Pro-inequality?  Fine with them.     Bad trade agreements?  Welcome! Hiring the same old bankers?  AOK.<br/><br/>70% of voters favor a higher minimum wage.  80% or more favor protecting Social Security.  So why can't Democrats win?  They don't care about those issues, or are even on the wrong side, as when Obama commissioned Simpson and Bowles to cut SS - which they almost did.<br/><br/>Democrats care much more about wedge issues than jobs and wages, and don't understand swing voters at all - because they themselves are so rigid, reactive, and tribal.  Bernie has the right mindset, but is rejected as not "pure" enough on wedge issues - which is exactly the kind of pol we need to build a coalition, raise wages, create jobs, and rebuild trust in government.Politicians don't discuss this issue because they have no solutions.  Raising the spectre of a future without most of the jobs people recognize today is a no-win proposition.  The radical solutions like a guaranteed annual income have no legitimacy because it reeks of "socialism." Instead politicians and journalists fall back on the hackneyed arguments in favor of better education and channeling people into STEM jobs.  It's an open question whether those jobs will also prove resilient in the face of ever-advancing information technologies, artificial intelligence, and high-tech manufacturing systems. Being a home health-care worker has arguably a better future than being a computer programmer if we're taking the long view.  Maybe someday we'll even figure out how to pay people in the human service vocations a living wage.Clarke's prophetic "The City and the Stars" envisioned a society where people had little traditional work to do, lived essentially isolated lives where they communicated electronically, and spent much of their time playing immersive videogames.  Sound familiar?Thank you for that, Elke. Made my day.Gaylord,<br/>So who is entitled to health care, and who isn't and why? In the 20th C dozens of countries decided that all their citizens were entitled--even their rw parties.  It's worked out pretty well---see intl OECD stats on well being and life expectancy, and middle class security. duh. <br/><br/>And what about the taxes we all pay to provide you with modern civilization? I pay taxes so you have roads, police, fire depts, city govt, trash pick up, armed forces, running water--etc. duh.Jerpme, my hint is that the two non-crossed letters are E and G."Yes, some jobs will become obsolete in the present form, but new and better ones will appear in their place."<br/><br/>That might be true, but it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be as many of those "new and better" jobs as the ones being replaced.  A more likely scenario is that there will be fewer and fewer jobs that require humans.  Moreover many of the jobs that will persist are in fields like human services which are not well-paid.  For instance, we might need more home health aides to care for an aging population, but those types of jobs are traditionally among the least remunerative. Even in those fields, robotics might displace human workers.  The Japanese are working hard to build humanoid robots to act as companions since their population has a shrinking base of young people and a rapidly growing elderly population.Barry,<br/><br/>You would think that on a Monday, the clue for OTRA would distinguish it from OTRO.  I'm used to leaving the final letter for a crossing, but I'm thinking it should be easier for a newbie.I almost never get to comment on any puzzle until Wordplay and the comments are history, but I'm not letting it stop me tonight.  I really, really liked Sunday's offering.  Joel did a great job.  I breezed through it, congratulating myself on the celerity with which I figured out those theme answers.  Ha!  When done, I circled "ottic," unable to figure out what the heck that would have to do with ghosts.  And that's how I ended up here, now completely chagrined to find that, in my haste, I hadn't paid much attention to the cross clue.  I saw "myth," assumed Greek, and dashed off "hero," as in Hero and Leander. Lather, rinse, repeat: Checked it again, saw "myth" again, and scurried off to Wordplay, where I've gotten my comeuppance.  <br/><br/>Also, I pretended that I didn't see "Ann Coulter" when I filled it in.  My blood pressure can't take it.  PK agrees with Bernanke---the stimulus case for deficit spending has gotten much weaker? Plz explain---- PK’s main claim as a liberal was he was pro spending, anti austerity. He said the Obama stimulus was too little.  <br/><br/>Any public investment program that succeeds, and thus legitimizes ‘big govt’ in the eyes of the voters, will be fought by conservatives---from either party. The Dems will offer weak resistance. <br/><br/>Corporations want low tax, no regulation, so they sponsor politicians who will fight govt programs that benefit the public. They and their clients would rather see our roads, bridges, water systems, transportation, etc crumble, than let govt to any public good. And rather see people sicken and die than have low cost health care for all.  <br/><br/>Successful govt in the eyes of the public might interfere with political trends that favor privatization. Elementary?It's not like Trump didn't question the legitimacy of President Obama every chance he got right up to his own election. He seems to believe in a very tilted self-royal double standard. I'm thankful for John Lewis.<br/><br/>Now please continue to educate me on economics.Greedy, bloated, and mindless, Trump continues to be the perfect embodiment of the American psyche.What amazes me is that the bitter enders imagine that a little Russian grease, real or imagined, is somehow more effective in turning the election than two billion dollars and the enthusiastic support of the entire United States Government for Mrs. Clinton. Meanwhile, President Trump did not even have a ground game worth mentioning in the crucial states he won.<br/><br/>I imagine Mr. Krugman knows better.  He's just comforting the afflicted, to quote Finley Peter Dunne. Or, more bluntly, the snowflakes.This felt like a Thursday puzzle!  Some of the clues were a stretch...Thanks Viv, and DC.  Of course I was just kidding around.  It's so much better than the bad old days when responses went through the Randomizer.   We have so much to worry about, recos don't make my top 100.  This happened before the living will law was passed in PA. We enlisted the help of a medical ethicist, who said this was the clearest case she had seen of a patient who should be allowed to stop his "treatment". But the hospital refused to listen to her counsel. The hospital had no ethics board. The doctor's privileges were removed by the hospital as a result of this horror show. Of course, he then moved his "research" to another hospital. One of the anesthesiologists said to me, "Dr. X has a big brain, but he has no heart."In choosing Judith Dunning's story to open this article, Paula Span shows that she understands--though her readers still may not-- the well-documented fact that it is fear of disability, not fear of pain, which drives people to this step.  Even Compassion &amp; Choices admits, in the words of the head of their New York office, that "Pain is not the issue."  This is because of the availability of palliative and terminal sedation, well-covered elsewhere in the NYT recently.<br/>    What led Ms. Dunning to end her life was fear of disability.  As another commenter has posted, all disability-rights organizations to take a position oppose these laws.<br/>"More centrally, Ms. Dunning . . . was losing her ability to speak. . . .<br/>'She felt she had completed all the important tasks of her life,' recalled her physician, Dr. Michael Rabow, director of the symptom management service at the University of California, San Francisco. 'When she could no longer communicate [via speech], life was no longer worth living.'"<br/>   Dr. Rabow's choice of words illustrates why so many disability-rights activists are very concerned that our lives, so often thought by able-bodied people to be "no longer worth living," are put at great risk by these laws.Anne, Dr. Rabow was referring to Ms. Dunning's feelings about what made life worth living, not his own.<br/>Years of data from Oregon and Washington do indeed show that pain is not the primary reason people choose to legally hasten their deaths. It's not even Reason #2 or #3.  They are driven by the "decreased ability to participate in the activities that make life enjoyable," and by loss of autonomy and dignity. This information is made public annually; it's no secret.The  consolation game between Green Bay and Atlanta should be far more entertaining than the Pats destroying either of these defense-less pretenders in the Super BowlThis is misdirection.  The dossier provides material that can be taken as data for a set of conjectures (in this case, hypotheses that cannot easily be tested by the press), provided by someone whose credentials were verified (by David Korn; see his article in Mother Jones), even if the content could not.  Investigation is very much in the public interest, but the press is unlikely to be capable of doing that investigation.  Do they then have the right to keep that material from public view?  Or do they have an obligation to publish to enable someone else to investigate?  I think the latter.A fine tribute puzzle. Sad to lose both ladies so close together. It's been a long time since I've seen the early Star Wars, so had to work a bit harder to solve the NE. Great clue for OWLS, a real winner. The puzzle was a little challenging for a Tuesday but not out of line.<br/><br/>Deb—I dispute the third sentence of your comment on 1A. In my junior year of college I took an elective Shakespeare course for non-English majors. We studied ten of the most popular plays in ten weeks—my first intensive exposure to the Bard. For years afterward I was instantly able to ID *any* snippet of dialogue from any of these plays—speaker, situation, location in the script—almost instinctively. I always knew that being able to do that wasn't due to any brilliance on my part but was solely a result of the perfection of Shakespeare's poetry, scripting, and construction. More than half a century later, coming up with ACT II was a breeze for me. I'm sure a lot of other solvers had a similar experience.<br/><br/>Also, Deb, a quibble, though with the dictionaries not you. To say that YAW "means to move back and forth along a flight path" is faulty in several ways. First, "back and forth," without some indicator of the direction of such movement, could as easily mean backward and forward, instead of side to side, its actual meaning. Second, YAWing is not limited to flight; a boat can also yaw in, and probably under, water. Also, planes landing in a stiff lateral wind may deliberately yaw after touching down to maintain a straight course on the runway.   VIOLENT felons [whether pardoned or having completed their sentences] should be PERMANENTLY barred from owning guns.<br/> [I exclude the cases where the pardon was because new evidence showed the person was wrongly convicted.]<br/>The Times article cited below describes cases where violent felons [including felons convicted of murder] legally obtained new guns and then used those guns to commit new crimes including murder.<br/>Whether felons should be allowed to vote is an entirely separate issue.<br/>The question of gun ownership and voting rights are entirely different.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/felons-finding-it-easy-to-regain-gun-rights.html?pagewanted=all" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/felons-finding-it-easy-to-regain-gun-rights.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/felons-finding-it-easy-to-regain-gu...</a><br/><br/>"Under federal law, people with felony convictions forfeit their right to bear arms. Yet every year, thousands of felons across the country have those rights reinstated, often with little or no review. In several states, they include people convicted of violent crimes, including first-degree murder and manslaughter, an examination by The New York Times has found.<br/>While previously a small number of felons were able to reclaim their gun rights, the process became commonplace in many states in the late 1980s, after Congress started allowing state laws to dictate these reinstatements — part of an overhaul of federal gun laws orchestrated by the National Rifle Association"In Pediatrics there is also a strong tradition of trying to give an answer to every question about the best way to raise a child. While it can help, it also can produce strongly worded recommendations that turn out to be just plain wrong, as this article highlights. As a pediatrician, I was and remain frustrated by the tendency for many supposed experts in pediatrics to try to micromanage and mandate almost every choice a parent can make, presenting so many things as an absolute right or wrong when we should admit we are quite often just not sure."Just as we went from tribes to capitalism, we are likely to go from capitalism to something entirely different."<br/>-------<br/>Such as?  Too many from politicians to economists to business leaders to random internet commenters like yourself always pull that rabbit out of their magic hat - something will happen because, well because it always has.<br/>What too many fail to realize is that this time is truly different.  What worked in a more sparsely populated pre-industrial or even industrial history is not going to work in our post-industrial world.We don't usually include reversing as a vessel's path's degree of freedom.  Of the three possible axial variations, roll, pitch and yaw, I think only yaw can be described as "back and forth."  I admit that the movement can be described with more precision, but I don't find that dictionary entry to be "wrong wrong."Please, Pres. Obama, please pardon those thousands of people and Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning.  Let one piece of paper combine all of the above.Put simply Obama's reluctance to use his powers of pardon is unpardonableTrue or not the President should assume that he is the ONLY one who will be showing any clemency for the forseeable future and act accordingly. If you want to talk legacy, this will count big time. Needless to say Manning and Snowden would make waves. But there are thousands whose lives you could make better. These people are precious like every person is. Don't be remembered as a fake President.Of course, there are unscrupulous schools interested mainly in making a buck regardless of the mayhem they cause. But another serious issue is that even for some who complete their training there is no work, or work only under very limiting conditions. The simple fact is that the modern economy cannot make use of them. <br/><br/>Of course, we know of the history behind many modern successes that began when talented people had to leave large corporations and start their own because their employers lacked the imagination to capitalize on their work. A lack of corporate imagination and the lengths to which large companies will go to stifle new ideas and kill competition is a trite tail today.<br/><br/>But the problem is actually bigger than the failure to see new opportunities to make money. It is the failure to see the corporation as a citizen capable of more than improving its own bottom line - capable of contributing far more than widgets and advertising and aristocrats, capable of enabling people to do creative and socially important work. Work, by the way, that absolutely must be done, even if it does not make the very comfortable even more comfortable.It is not true that independent state boards do a good job determining clemency. They have been shown to be affected by how close to meals appeals come before them. They suffer from availability bias in that, after a report of a parolee committing a crime, they refuse any clemency decisions for years.I agree that President Obama should use the pardon power more often.  It is not the fault of the pardoned person that her selection appears to have been the result of a lottery.  Your suggestions about the office of the president using the power more objectively and transparently as many states do is excellent.  But your description of the pardon power as applying only to convicted persons who have served their sentences is completely incorrect.  Please recall that President Ford pardoned Richard Nixon before he had ever been charged with a crime.  While I am sure that there are many persons deserving of a pardon, one person should clearly receive one, Hillary Clinton.  She has been through enough.  The electrician at work offered to bet me (after I lost $20 to him on the election) in a telling example of the confidence and chutzpah of the right wing mind that, "Obama will pardon Hillary Clinton before he leaves office." I accepted, for $30. <br/><br/>I know, I know, for what you ask? Numerous, cocksure reasons rolled off his tongue for the necessity of a pardon, as though when not wiring large houses for very wealthy people he's an understudy fill-in for Alex Jones. <br/><br/>He's a good man for the most part, though I hate his pandering to the wealthy politics. We are opposites but respect each other at work. It is useful having a super hard core right wing insider to interact with, so that the "weird thought magic" going on in that side of America can be understood in the context of a person with a face whom you get along with at work.You haven't seen abysmally low yet. Wait until Trump gets into office.Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive Marc Rich, so maybe there another deep pocket contributor out there who should also be pardoned.I have a hard time imagining that pardons will be anywhere on Trumps agenda... except for the few white-collar criminals. who are white.I agreed with every point made here, except the last sentence, which is gratuitously aggressive and patently impossible.  Yes, Obama's pardon record is abysmal.  Do the editors really believe his successor will learn from Obama or even has the compassion to consider more pardons? President Obama, for all the weight he has carried on his shoulders alone, has been willing to use clemency, especially for non-violent drug offenders.  He has spoken very convincingly about the injustice of disproportionate sentences for minor crimes.<br/>President Obama is, however, but one person and has just days left in office.  He alone cannot right the wrongs of our criminal justice system.  This will take a concerted effort to reach Congress and Governors to rewrite legislation keeping more people from being incarcerated in a lopsided manner for respective offenses.  Even the Koch brothers have expressed support for rewriting the laws.<br/>Seeing the forest for the trees means looking far beyond President Obama's last days. When did a seven years in jail become ho-hum?While Manning's behavior was abysmal there is no evidence that anyone died as a result. Facts please.I wish I were wrong or a liar, Max.  This is one of the flaws in ACA, the huge disparity in premiums, with no relationship to usage.<br/>The statements are accurate and easy to verify.  Go to the calculator and use these inputs:<br/>State = CT<br/>Zip = 06601<br/>Income = $65,000<br/>People = 2 Adults<br/>Ages = 62, 64 (non-smokers)<br/>This is what you get:<br/>$2,282 per month ($27,389 per year)<br/>in premiums (which equals 42.14% of your household income)." confuse health INSURANCE and health CARE."<br/><br/>A phony distinction...... All health policies by law in America provide free preventive services with no co-pays or deductibles.You need to understand how insurance works.Nonsense....of those supposed 18 million many had insurance via their employer prior to ACA rolling out. And of the remaining many were getting it elsewhere or going to the ER and not paying at all. Bottom-line is the ACA is falling apart and many states are already seeing double digit increases.In some (many?) cases the premiums tripled so that it is not financial sensible to enroll.  As a result, we've been uninsured for three years.  Our premium is roughly 5 times the actuarially fair amount.  I think that is reasonably characterized as destroying the market.If it wasn't for the fact that Obama ran with a platform of reforming health insurance and having a 16 million edge voter mandate to realize that vision, I would have to pretend the Republicans are right to cherry-pick the worst situations, paint the whole nation with the same pessimistic brush, and sail headlong into destroying a popular government initiative. But the situation isn't the way the GOP portrays it, with only the most extreme cases of unintended consequences put in place of practical example.  I wish what the politicians could do would be to actually go to work, just this once, and see if a solution couldn't be worked out om the ACA now that scapegoat number one is leaving the picture.  It wouldn't even have to be a compromise, it could be a similar law with the things that work left in and the things that caused problems fixed, Trump gets what he want's, and the Repubs save face. But the problem is and always will be blind devotion to partisan ideology, rendering the GOP paralyzed when the crunch is on.  Maybe in 2018 voter sentiment will finally overcome Koch spending and gerrymandering and Dems can then fix what is a fruitless exercise in preserving public participation in restoring the common good.As imperfect as the ACA is, to take away health insurance from Americans who now have it is shameful, backwards, and cruel, not to mention the worst sort of partisan politicking by millionaires who happen to get great coverage with their jobs, and who will not be impacted (except they might make more money for themselves or their families and for insurance company stockholders and CEOs). When the ACA was first implemented, I actually lost health *care* I liked in order to get insurance coverage with the ACA. I live in a city that offered, and has promised to always offer, health care to folks who live here, which is a relief, though it is getting harder and harder to live here; the care doesn't function as insurance, however, so to avoid a federal penalty I purchased insurance through my state ACA exchange, Covered California. While I still hold out hope for us to join the rest of the countries that offer single payer style care, having insurance I can afford thanks to the ACA has been a good thing. Let's move forward to single payer, not backward to what will surely cost some of us our lives. I hope states start seriously looking into implementing universal health care and it gets to the point where the feds have to follow.That's not how it works. People with inadequate coverage tend to need the most expensive care because they put off going to the doctor, and then they can't afford the bill. Guess who gets stuck helping the hospital 'make up the difference'? People like us, who are insured. Premiums and deductibles will not come down. They will continue to increase, because insurance companies will be unfettered. <br/><br/>Also, children living in poverty can't earn coverage.Republican, Democrat. Doesn't matter. If the only health insurance you can afford is practically free, and the only reason it's practically free is because other people are being overcharged, then tough luck.Call and write your representative in Congress people! Write to the local paper, call your chamber of commerce, call your senators and for god's sake, we must all call the prez-elect's office since he does not do email! The message I send is always the same: why can't we have the same insurance mitch Mc Connell and Paul Ryan have? Yeah, why not?  That pesky govt insurance sure seems to work well for them. The failure of the young and healthy to make this scheme pay off as promised was NO accident. It was fully intentional.<br/><br/>If single-payer is the way to go, you need to consider WHY Vermont could NOT come up with a workable single-payer system. Don't stick Americans with stuff that even sweet liberal Vermont could not make work. The numbers and the studies are overwhelming.  This is no way to dispute that ACA caused huge increases in the premiums for unsubsidized users of the individual market.  In many cases, that means self-employed and small business.So glad to hear that! I used to live in E WA. Never did like her- too smug, false compassion. Can honest to goodness American's with millions and billions of dollars get together to start an (HONEST insurance and pharmaceutical company), where the premiums and drugs are within everyone's reach. I'm begging for the good people who care about others to put their heads together and do their best to help the 18 million who are about to loose the first decent health care, some the first time covered, for them?  For the common good!  Please?  The CBO projections from the mid-1960s of what Medicare would cost in 1990 was the biggest clean joke of the century. They were off by 740%.<br/>Oh yeah - the sales pitch was that it would not add to the budget deficit. Apparently you believe that our Senators have some special health insurance plan, but that's not the case.   Passage of the ACA required that they and their staffs purchase insurance through an exchange.   Most are on the DC exchange.   A few (Ted Cruz and Elizabeth Warren, for instance) are on their spouse's plan, but for the most part if Congress repeals ACA, they repeal their own health insurance plan.   <br/><br/>Both supporters and opponents of the ACA, have been operating on too few facts and way too much conjecture.    For all those rotten souls who blame poor people, and all of us on Obamacare, for raising their rates, (a complete myth), wait until they see their rates go thru the roof when the 20 million of us soon to be uninsured overwhelm the hospital ER's. Who will pay for the uninsured? The insured. More uninsured will lead to skyrocketing premiums and deductible. The joke will be on all of you cruel fools.<br/>America truly is a heartless, soulless, savage nation. Part of it anyway. Manning apologized for her acts, did not try to flee the country, and served seven years in prison. Snowden has not apologized, is living in Russia, and has served no prison time.Japan’s explicit price controls are roughly emulated in other countries via the use monopsonistic systems. Monopsony, meaning “single buyer” is the flip side of monopoly. A monopsonist sets prices below free market equilibrium. It does not matter if there is an actual single payer or many buyers (or payers) whose prices are set by the government or by insurance companies in collusion with each other. More competition among sellers generally leads to lower prices. However, more competition among buyers leads to higher prices. In the health insurance industry the beneficial effects of more insurance companies competing for patients are far outweighed by the adverse effects of insurance companies competing for doctors and hospitals in their HMO plans. This was completely misunderstood during the recent debate on health care reform. With health care, more competition among insurance companies on balance results in higher prices.<br/><br/>Focusing attention on the insurance companies, which are simply intermediaries between the doctors and the patients, was a tragic error. It would like trying to solve a problem of high energy prices by focusing on gasoline stations. Only if the government sets prices can health care  prices be controlled. Controlling prices does not automatically result in longer waiting times. Japan and Switzerland generally have shorter waiting times to see doctors than does the USA. Additionally, if prices were controlled ..."<br/><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1647632" title="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1647632" target="_blank">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1647632</a>Republican Congressman Paul Ryan has a long term obsession with the wrong economic guru.<br/><br/>He has no serious interest as to family financial hardships, profoundly drastic illness, or medical bankruptcies of ordinary people.<br/>Not long ago Jesuit scholars from Georgetown University called him out on his hypocrisy by informing him his budget plan “appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”<br/><br/>You might recall Ryan blamed poverty on the culture of inner city men and claimed poor children getting free lunches at school lack caring parents. <br/><br/>Clearly, Ryan and his crew need to repeal their own healthcare benefits they obtained through Obamacare.

That is part of the problem with having an uninsured population: uncompensated care adding to the costs passed on to those with private insurance. We all pay for that care one way or another.You didnt save for childhood cancer? Multiple Sclerosis? Cystic Fibrosis? Shame on you, what a bad decision you made not to plan, on an average salary, to have $200-500-900K put aside for health care costs.  What an ignorant view of the world you have.

Death panels for the poor already ...No one should be able to decide that one life is somehow more valuable than another, not even an individual about his own life.<br/><br/>Our society once placed value in improving the lot of those who are "poor" in some way or another, including the poverty of frailty and mental illness.<br/><br/>We also placed value in resilient, in those able to live their lives despite their circumstances, including the circumstances of failing physical and mental health.<br/><br/>People's fear of suffering, not the suffering itself, drives people to assisted suicide, and that is made very clear both by the article and by the comments here.  A woman can no longer talk and so her life must end? And we as a society are to affirm her in this? <br/><br/>No one wants to have dementia, but if I should develop it then my life needs to be ended?  That those with it should not have "valuable medical resources" wasted on them? That our life is somehow no longer valuable as another life and so we will end it, and as a society we nod in collective agreement? No, that life is worth our concern and care the same as every other life, not shunned as a life to be destroyed.<br/><br/>FIRST do no harm, then we can talk about autonomy. Aim for beneficence and we will achieve justice.  Keep autonomy within these other three guiding principles, not as the trump card over them all.Right to die humanely with assistance from a physician,  should become a universal human right. People who have good reason to end their lives should be able to do so. This is critical to ensure that people don't commit suicides by resorting to blowing themselves apart with guns or by hanging or jumping off a high rise. The world should not be so cruel as to not understand the pain and suffering of another person and to not let that person end their own suffering in a humane manner. Jack Kervokian was a thinker ahead of his time and unless there has been some innovative painless way to end lives for those who are suffering extremely, then the Kevorkian suicide machine should be the accepted device that can be used and special places can be designated to conduct physician supervised and assisted suicide, with a coroner as a witness and a religious representative at their side if the person ending his or her life chooses. There are roughly 40,000 suicides occurring every year and that number will not change, but what can change is that they will die with dignity, compassion and acceptance by family and friends. I've been watching the Price hearing for some time, about two hours, on a C-Span re-run. All I can see is Democrats doing the usual attack dog postures and the Republicans asking the protective questions. How unusual that they would all take partisan positions. But, just as the Reps embarrassed themselves in the last Benghazi hearing where Clinton last testified, I see the Dems embarrassing themselves here - and in other some other hearings. Sens. Murray, Whitehouse and especially Sanders in particular. I thought Sen. Paul, who I admire b/c he is not afraid of bucking Reps. when he feels it due, had a great rebuttal to Sanders. I wish school children could hear it.<br/><br/>And, as usual w/ Mr. Trump (who I have never supported except to say he deserves a chance and that the opposition has moved beyond hysteria). So far, watching as many hearings as I can, I felt that the nominees have made a good account of themselves. The media versions of their hearings are not very accurate, but basically slanted to accepting the Dem charges, rather than listening to his answers, which are quite moderate and thoughtful. Trumpublicans, enablers and bullies all, think they can fix all this.<br/><br/>They want to repeal and replace the environment and the planet.<br/><br/>(h/t Bill Mahr)Dr. K,<br/><br/>Eventually health insurance will be a right of all Americans.  One of the best programs we have for health insurance performance is the program called Medicare.  It is a good program, I am on it and it is great,  I only wish that the insurance coverage included dental, hearing and eye care so even if I were homeless, I could have good teeth, hearing and vision. <br/><br/>So all we really need to do is staff the Medicare program with more people to take care of the expansion of the insurance.  It will be a glorious system, no Medicaid, No VA,  <br/><br/>By taking the insurance question off the table, we can turn our attention to the healthcare delivery system.  It needs work and I think we can create the best health outcomes oriented system in the world.  The system is a natural monopoly and market based competition doesn't really fit the requirements of modern society.  <br/><br/>Should we fund environmental protection, global disease monitoring and control, food and drug regulation and the biomedical research at universities and the NIH? I think so.  Health insurance has been given far too much attention.  <br/><br/>In truth,as everyone knows, It really has been mainly a good, steady and reliable means of raising campaign funds and to milk the pharmaceutical amd medical industries for campaign funds. The health insurance issue has been divisive and polarizing and essentially has distracted public attention from more important issues.How is it "treason" to reveal that our government was spying on its own citizens? Not a shred of evidence has come forth even to suggest that our national security was strengthened by the work that Snowden and his colleagues were engaged in.Why was Price's broker buying such medical stocks? Did Price never tell him to avoid stocks which could violate the Stock Act, or otherwise present ethical issues? Has Price never heard of index funds?That's really funny.Riiiight.  Trump will create jobs by "stimulating the economy" (a vague assertion with no details to back it up) and Price will create better health care for everyone (with no details to back it up).  America, welcome to the con game.  Could anyone be more legalistic, vague, non-committal, and beyond any promise to actually, specifically do what he only implies and claims adoration to.Isn't it amazing that a sharp-witted fellow like Price, who prides himself on being on top of every detail about the ACA and all its flaws, conveniently claims ignorance about his highly unethical stock purchases that scream out conflict of interest. Price, like the man who nominated him, lives by the creed that greed is good. He will be rammed through as HHS head and look for 30 million defenseless people to be devastated by his pay for play approach to health care.America will be shocked to see this part of the government actually conducted with total RESPECT of the LAW. We have gotten so accustomed to lawlessness from this failed president and his administrators that lawful activity will take  to again.<br/>What is the sad part of these hearings? People who only lecture the camera and then plead for more time so that they can continue to lecture us. "Lofty goals but vague details.."<br/><br/>Yes indeed.  Exactly what we got from the Obama administration.  And bad outcomes.<br/><br/>Are you sure you aren't projecting?Critics of republican plans told me to listen for the language used as a cover for the scam the republicans are planning to work on the American people/healthcare:  "access to" and "high risk pools".  Price repeated each several times.  As Bernie said to him "I have ACCESS to buy a million dollar home, doesn't mean I have the money to pay for it."  I had a good laugh at that, but it's no laughing matter.<br/>Sorry, but this man was the picture of a smug, money-grubber who may have gone into medicine to help his fellow citizens but soon decided he liked helping himself more.  No shame whatsoever in admitting that he knowingly and personally bought stocks prior to introducing and passing legislation he knew would greatly increase the value of those stocks.  America, I think you're losing your mind...it'll be walking out the front door of the White House on Friday.The film-flam continues. Is this "The Apprentice- Presidential Edition" ???<br/>Every hearing reveals the ignorance and distain of the supposed subject of the "candidates" expertise.  Random people chosen off the street could show more enthusiasm and desire to do the job, rather than assume a "position".  So sad.The GOP has had no problem letting people fall through the cracks, so why do we believe them now?  I don't believe this guy for one minute.  I have noticed that they are big on talking about "access".  Well, everyone has always had access if you had money.  Even with a preexisting condition you could get insurance if you paid enough money for it.  Access isn't the same as availability.  The ACA's didn't go far enough in controlling costs - which is very difficult in the current environment.  I have no faith the GOP will come up with what Trump is claiming - great insurance lower cost, for all.<br/> I also feel that we need to demand that people elected to Congress must establish blind trusts - it is clear to me that they use their information and positions in order to enrich themselves - and that goes for both sides of the aisle.   To see this guy sit there and claim that all his stock trading was ethical was disgusting.  While it may be legal, we should not allow these people to profit from their offices, which is what many of them apparently do.Price is such a hypocrite. Blue states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey have already expanded medicaid program benefiting their constituents. His state of Georgia and the of the red states have no such program thereby restricting to medical access. Take note, he is a surgeon set of mind. He prefers professional fees for his procedure out of patient's pocket than being dictated by a third party payer for his procedure. That is why he lauded Indiana's conservative healthcare policy because it promote "personal responsibility", that is, paying out of your pocket.Insider trading and not paying employment taxes are non-starters for those that view the commons as something important and worth defending.<br/><br/>For the average Trump supporter, these are scams they want to get in on themselves.  These aren't disqualifying things for the GOP - ripping off the public or Uncle Sam is probably expected among a significant set.Price has said and done zero to dispel the stink of corruption surrounding his genius investments. And so, as with Trump himself and so many of Trump's nominees, Price is starting off so low many are without doubt hoping the only direction for him to go is up. To characterize this complacent attitude in Trump-esque fashion, one word: Wrong!As Alan Rusbridger so ably explains in a parallel article, Snowden was appalled by the deception he found and took steps to inform us, the American people, what our government was doing. It's quite a dilemma.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/snowden-does-not-deserve-the-threat-he-faces.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/snowden-does-not-deserve-the-threat-he-faces.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/snowden-does-not-deserve-the-...</a><br/><br/>"I have since met Mr. Snowden on three occasions and have found him to be thoughtful, consistent, levelheaded and public-spirited. He regards the American Constitution with extreme reverence. He has accepted his exile as the price of what he, and others, see as principled action. His technical knowledge afforded him insights into how the power between the state and the citizen was being transformed, perhaps irrevocably."<br/><br/>We are stuck so often between a rock and a hard place, with our government doing things that ultimately cause a great deal of harm, and Trump set to make it much much worse (repeal and replace the planet, they will, along with death panels for the poor), that principled action has become almost impossible.<br/><br/>If we are to survive, we are going to have to stop the looting and exploiting that has become the norm. And Christians need to return to the Jesus of the gospels, not this market based exclusionary judgmental stuff that would put him in Gitmo if he were to appear today. Jesus was, after all, a "terr'ist" according to so many today, should they actually have to deal with him as he was.Snowden should be pardoned for letting us all know what our government was doing - spying on American citizens.<br/><br/>Leonard Peltier should be pardoned because he may not have been guilty of the act with which he was charged. He's very old now and reported to be in frail health. He should be allowed to live out his final days as a free citizen. Native Americans were here first in any case.I thought the strategy is to repeal it with a future expiration date and then watch it blow up because of the repeal.  Then they can say it blew up, anything we pass is better.  Then they will actually jump through hoops and disguise costs and cut benefits with something similar but less effective than Obamacare.  The most important part will be to see that only Clinton voters wind up with less. Mistakes may be made. It's a tricky feat to pull off but not impossible.  Krugman makes the whole idea of repeal as doomed to failure.  Just like his pronouncement on Trump's campaign.  But Krugman is infallible, it was Putin and Comney who stole the election and not Democratic stupidity and neglect that made it even close. He is not arguing that philosophy is only fit for european white men. I believe what my professor is arguing is that modern academic philosophy or 'real' philosophy has become entrenched in this western school of thought in which philosophy is only to be debated amongst credited scholars. Hence the notion that one studies philosophy to teach philosophy without any practical applications. This notion is true only of western academic 'real' philosophy a field which has been historically dominated by white men and largely neglects the teachings of oriental thinkers.Lung cancer is on the rise and no smoking signs are appearing in public setting including the high school, but your quote of 7% gov’t revenue is very telling; what is needed is cancer among those current in power. They have the benefit of filtered air in work place and homes compared with others. Attend a social event and cigarettes are passed out at the door and offered again on the dining table. When introduced to a new acquaintance a man will be offered cigarette by another; deep in the social milieu. But my American father smoked 2 packs a day (and died young) and it was an American thing for far too long, as you well know in N.C.. Maybe China can change.Hundreds of thousands, probably millions, of Chinese professionals have studied abroad. They know the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia and they often travel to these countries on vacation. It is impossible to believe that they or their families could take seriously a statement like "The first option for hostile forces infiltrating us is our education system." As for "devilish claws", they would laugh. The government is clinging to this kind of thing because its moral authority is so low, but only the uninformed would believe it.Save from moving it from impoverishment to world’s second highest GNP, with a little help from Wall St.<br/>What Trump can do with help from a Rep. Congress we will know soon enough.Global warmiing is worth concern for those worry about earths futIt is time for Mongolia to rejoin China. <br/><br/>The CIA facts show a 2011 population of 3.13 million, and a 2010 GDP of $6.125 billion. <br/><br/>Mongolia is landlocked (so what if it has lots of minerals, they can't be airfreighted out); and it has terrible management. Average household income is like $2,000-3,000 a year. If Beijing goes in with an invitation for Mongolia to join a Federated Union, by offering US$50,000 (this is close to a lifetime of current income per family) upfront per head (which comes to US$160 Billion), commitment to invest another US$200 Billion for development, plus setting up a trust fund that pays 3% of all mineral extractions to the natives, now that'd be something to talk about. <br/><br/>Local politics would still be left to the locals. The new money and new spendable wealth would most likely all be spent locally and regionally, and it would further benefit growth to the regional economies. <br/><br/>Beats buying stocks in Blackstone or Goldman Sachs. <br/><br/>It is quite unlikely that this can be accomplished by 2030. But contingent plans should be in place. As depressing as the political situation here in the U.S. has become, it is nothing compared to the ongoing plight of Tibet. My heart goes out to these kind, unassuming people.makes China look small and pettySad. The Dalai Lama is cool. China is not.Congratulations to NYT for highlighting and drawing attention to a part of the world forgotten and ignored by the media. In a world riven by political unrest, violence, religious intolerance, wanton destruction of ancient cultures, humanitarian crises and more.... The Dalai Lama represents a breath of pristine thinking. He is both a spiritual leader and by his example a concept that is rapidly fading away from the international scene. Let us hope Mongolia's capitulation to Chinese pressure will not end up like Tibet's own sad saga of a half century and more ago. As we ring in the New a Year stories such as this are heartening. They remind us there are still places on earth where countries are trying hard to cling to their heritage which are based on belief systems drawn from sources that differ from Abrahmic definitions of dogmatic religions and Marxist doctrines of hegemony. The tolerance inherent in such thinking that the Dalai Lama inspires and propagates offers us a glimmer of hope as we ring in the New Year.Mongolia is currently in an economic recession.  China also increased import taxes on goods from Mongolia immediately after the Dalai Lama's visit this time.  Minerals being a main export in this landlocked country, this must have sent a subtle but strong message to the Mongolian government.Every sentient being is endowed with Buddha nature and has the capacity to become a Buddha.  Awakening to your true nature does not require the Dali Lama to reincarnate.  The dharma wheel will continue to turn.  Peace and happiness to all.  It's a sad sign of China's never-ending insecurity that the travels of an elderly holy man inspire such terror and rage amongst the Communist dictators of Beijing.I think that someone whose main mission is an ocean of wisdom, should be given wide latitude in their freedoms to teach and to travel The Chinese have been busy in 2016, imprisoning Tibetans, razing Tibetan monasteries and harassing governments who ddare to acknowledge the wisdom and inner beauty of one of the most impressive spiritual leaders of our time. <br/><br/>One cannot really blame the Mongolian government for trading their politics for loan guarantees. After all, this will do nothing to change the affection and respect the Mongolian people have for HH the Dala Lama, nor the distaste we all have for Chinese bullying. Despite leaders who lust for power and use it to amass more wealth and power for themselves and their cronies, the hearts of the people of this world will always recognize and prize Goodness.<br/><br/>"Kindness is my religion," the Dalai Lama has said.<br/><br/>It is interesting to contemplate what kind of person would be threatened by someone like that.<br/><br/>May 2017 be the year when good, caring women, men and children in every country on the planet will rise up and find their strength in a global community of kindness.Hopefully, Mongolia will honor its historic ties to Tibet and the Dalai Lama, and not succumb to the bully-boy racist Han tactics of the CCP.The best thing the Dalai Lama can do is to reaffirm that he will be the last Dalai Lama. China is extremely unhappy about the prospect because it will take away a political tool. More important to Buddhism is that it will put an end to a speculative system of power inheritance that deviated from the original teachings of the Buddha. By the end of his life, the Buddha was asked to appoint a successor to lead his followers. The Buddha absolutely rejected the idea. He said that his teaching itself together with the set of monastic code of conduct are sufficient as a guide for all Buddhists. For centuries in India and elsewhere it prevented the pitfall of power struggle that is common in other religions.What a pity that ideological indoctrination is compulsory for young Chinese kids, but not in the least surprising in light of the current administration's obsession with stability. There is a glaring discrepancy between the government drive to transform China into a leading global innovator, and the requirement of monochromatic thinking among its intellectual class. Creativity comes from those who think differently, who don't conform to instructional norms, and not from those who test well on conventional exams. Herein lies the Chinese conundrum. As a parent I am extremely wary of our public schools using IB as a curriculum. No country should allow another country to develop their school curriculum. Even in Switzerland, where IB is developed, only a handful of international schools use this curriculum. Virtually no other country adopt IB as a PUBLIC school curriculum except in the US. We are the new cash cow for IB. <br/><br/>The "forward thinking" leftist open borderists now running our school system love IB. It's their globalist dream come true. A curriculum that truly promotes the "One World" view. 11th grade US history is replaced by "History of the Americas". English Lit studies translated work from Asian and African countries rather than Shakespeare or Dickens. US children don't even know their own country's history. 70+ US universities including George Washington University now do not even require a single US history course to graduate as a History major. <br/><br/>The left who's been dominating our education system are doing everything they can to kill off the concept of nation states, to promote their grand vision of a "global village" complete with open borders and multiculturalism, and IB is their weapon of choice. Schools in Houston are now offering IB starting in elementary school. Start the brainwashing from as young as possible. Our district now wants to introduce "social studies" to elementary school, just like what the Chinese are doing in this article.No worries. We are heading for convergence. Our schools in the US from K-college have been teaching kids the evil of inequality and emphasizing the glory of  equality, as in achieving equal outcome, which is the basis of Communism. <br/><br/>Kids today are no longer taught the fall of the Soviet Union and its causes. Equality is glorified in the form of Socialism. Of course, as we all know the only difference between Socialism and Communism is elections, one has the pretense of democracy, the other simply does away with it as it's no longer necessary when everyone depends on the state for livelihood. <br/><br/>Judging from the reaction of the butt hurt generation on the result of this election, I'd say our Indoctrination I mean Education System has been doing such a fine job with the brainwashing of our youth the past 4 decades there is no longer a need for Socialism, we are ready to go straight to Communism. Why bother with elections when only one outcome is acceptable?I don't believe that the conflict is between Western and Chinese values. The very fact that so many Chinese are chafing under compulsory political education (or ignoring it), and that so many Chinese parents are anxious for their kids to get out of that system, shows that at least some of the "Western" values feared by the party leadership are more universal than they think. This is not say that there are no "Chinese" values worth preserving, such as dedication to family. But rigidly prescribing the boundaries of acceptable thought cannot, and should not, work. Not a pip? Odd that, I live a rural Northern California town, and I have read of this movie.The crossword app clue for 3D says "Capital of Iran", yet the answer is the currency of Iran (rial). That messed me up!"The rules would not apply to international schools set up primarily to educate foreign students."<br/><br/>The takeaway from this whole brouhaha, of course, is the definition of "foreign students." The Chinese government doesn't and won't regulate education for foreigners, but it'll be most interesting to see how those Chinese who have money to finagle their kids into international schools are going to be yielded, or not. And they certainly can't hide behind those expensive "private schools."<br/><br/>Would the next step of the government be more regulation for international schools operating in the country to ask for foreign citizenship proof before they enroll a student? That would be a logical next-step to put up the wall between genuine "foreign students" from those "local students" with rich parents.You would be better served to read up on Chinese history before you make a comment like yours (which shows your lack of understanding of that country, their history, and culture).So what is it you want? Slavery? Segregation? Women prevented from accessing education and jobs?I hope he speaks out loudly and often whenever Mr. Trump does something egregious. He has more than every right to do so: he was an extraordinary president during an extraordinary time under extraordinary circumstances. <br/><br/>This election was contentious and saw the most contentious candidate elected. But even more important, the entire Democratic campaign was based on the fact Donald J Trump is simply mentally unfit, scholastically unprepared, and professionally unqualified for the office he is about to hold.<br/><br/>President Obama would be remiss if he didn't speak out. It might not change things but how could anyone knowing this departing president expect him to remain silent when his own achievements and values are so badly tarnished by a man of the caliber of Trump?My biggest concern as a psychologist is that Mitchell and Jesse be successfully sued for every penny they earned. It is my belief that even before we changed the ethics code, their behavior clearly qualified as unethical. But maybe the code I read only pertained to clinical psychologists like me. I thought that the military psychology division was for psychologists who treated patients in the military. Now that I know what they do, I think this division should be abolished.<br/>As to the report, we need another whistle-blower hero to leak it."Enhanced interrogation" was never anything more than punishment of the cruel and unusual variety. "Intelligence gathering" was the supposed rationale for this inhumane treatment, but in fact no "significant actionable" inttelligence was ever gathered. Truth be told, some Americans feel torture is appropriate punishment, whether it yields intelligence or not. The Constitution does not agree.Until George W Bush- our first Supreme Court appointed President- the United States policy was to not torture people. It does not work, is cruel and inhuman punishment, increases the likelihood American prisoners will be tortured, yields fall evidence that sends troops and operatives on wild goose chases and undermines any moral authority we as a nation might have.<br/><br/>The British tortured American Soldiers in ships docked in New York during the Revolutionary War. With knowledge of that, General Washington made it policy to not torture British prisoners. Later, Tribunals the US convened executed foreign Civilians and Military Officers for waterboarding Americans as war crimes. How is it any less a war crime for our CIA to do the same?<br/><br/>I wonder of the values of a country where so many think Ed Snowden is a traitor, but think waterboarding is OK. I wonder of a Justice Department that has failed to punish those involved. I wonder of a President-Elect who thinks torture is OK and underlings who would gladly push the documentation down the memory hole. What kind of people have we become that our values have become so warped?<br/><br/>A quote widely attributed to Benjamin Franklin went like this:<br/>“Well, Doctor, what have we got—a Republic or a Monarchy?”<br/>  “A Republic, if you can keep it.”<br/><br/>I'm not so sure we are keeping our Republic and we have strayed far from the ideals it was founded upon.We can expect this treatment to be brought upon our captured soldiers by our adversaries now until the end of the wars of man. I truly hope my children are not subjected to "enhanced interrogation techniques," (or worse tactics than outlined here in other reports) should they ever be captured serving their country. Sleep well service parents...Barbarism breeds barbarism... Torture is wrong from the perspective of simply being human as well as the fact that US military personnel are more likely to be tortured by their opponents if they engage in it themselves. You folks wonder why they hate us they dont hate us for our freedoms they hate us because we have destroyed their country and tortured them. It is like this for a so called Christian country they obviously dont follow the Golden Rule: Of Do Unto To Others As You Would Have Done Unto You. We ought to be sickened of how we have done this to these people.Torture violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 18 U.S.C. 2340A. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and UNCAT (The UN Convention Against Torture).<br/><br/>George W. Bush and Dick Cheney presided over the most extensive apparatus of torture implemented by any presidential administration since the birth of the American republic. They are war criminals.<br/><br/>Given the fact that they were at the apex of the most economically and militarily powerful country on earth, it is unlikely they will ever find themselves in the dock of the International Criminal Court at the Hague.<br/><br/>A possibly more productive approach for those interested in justice on this issue is outlined by Philippe Sands in his book "Torture Team": go after the six key lawyers in the Bush/Cheney administration who provided the legal rationale for Bushco's torture regime. The Bush Six are:<br/><br/>* David Addington, Dick Cheney's chief of staff<br/>* Jay Bybee and John Yoo of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel<br/>* Alberto Gonzales, attorney general<br/>* Doug Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy<br/>* Jim Haynes, general counsel to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld<br/><br/>The documents they generated providing legal cover for torture were not free speech, they were incitements to commit crimes. May they receive the justice they so richly deserve.theoretically, yes, but it costs money to build new locker rooms, who's going to pay for it.  should this be the taxpayer priority for infrastructure spending or decaying roads and bridges that people die on like in Minneapolis (all people, including potentially transgender people); decaying water and sewer systems (used by all people, including potentially transgender people, who presumably want to drink clean public water); airports, trains, etc.  I said nothing about the Curiel matter. I said nothing about the government making something different for straight vs LGBT. I said that diverse groups with a variety of perspectives are more representative, and that a variety of perspectives and ideas leads to better outcomes. If deliberate, too dishonest for the position. If inadvertent, too financially incompetent.The government is now controlled by people who value money and power above the good of the country. They will not do their job and will delay anything getting done by a member of another political party. They will pander to their extremist base in order to stay in power. They will lie to the people, say they are for them, and once elected, kowtow to the rich who gives them the money and power. They will do anything, even if it does harm to our country and its citizens, in order to get and keep money and power. They would even ask for help from foreign dictators wishing to destroy the US in order to get that power and money. In my youth we called such people "traitors" -- today they call themselves "Republicans."Try reading the article first. He did not fail to disclose $100mm of assets in the Caymans. The assets he failed to disclose were real estate in the US and Mexico; this is quite clearly stated in the article.<br/><br/>It is also very clear (reported elsewhere, but of course not here), that there was no tax evasion. What he failed to disclose re the Cayman funds were his management roles, not his ownership. And as reported elsewhere, and as he said at the hearing, his ownership of Cayman funds was included in his disclosures. Those disclosures also show he paid taxes on income from those funds.<br/><br/>Sad to see that more than 1,000 "critical thinkers"  reflexively recommended this half-baked comment because it said what they wanted to be true, rather than what was true. I thought only those uneducated Republicans liked fake news.Sociologists have classified lies into 3 types, starting from the weakest to the worse:<br/>1) The unintentional lie, where the speaker does not know that what he says is not true;<br/>2) The "white lie" where you know it is false but you do not want to hurt someone's feelings; and<br/>3) A Republican talking point.<br/><br/>I only believe half of what a politician says, unless that politician is a Republican. Then I believe none of it.How is it gratuitous?  Krugman and his intellectual and political kin are the reason we're stuck with Donald Trump.  He can't possibly not know it.  Nothing gets better till the Democrats understand that everything that is now happening is on them.  They're the ones that gave it away.  It took them nearly two generations, but they've squandered the nation's learned lessons from the Great Depression and WWII and aided and abetted the right in turning the country and world into a toxic strip mall and life into a tawdry, shallow, meaningless acquisition competition that devalues the lives of anybody outide a 100 feet radius.so, when Hillary gave speeches at Goldman Sachs it was heralded as really bad, but now that an actual banker with interests in a tax haven will become treasury secretary, what should then one think?Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely!

They'd all be disgusted by this.hold it - he is not a crook - he only appears to be one.tut tut my good man - a mere bag of shells.nope - just spent money on absolute necessities only - and tank the economy -I can't decide which one of Trump's top-tier picks is the worst. Is it the treasury man who couldn't figure out how to fill out a basic financial form? Is it the education choice who sneers at public schools? The would-be labor secretary who doesn't believe in giving workers breaks? The state department nominee who doesn't know the difference between foreign diplomacy and foreign business deals?<br/>Is it stupidity, ignorance or good old ego that makes the choices for attorney general, energy secretary, and health and human services head think it's OK to take a job when they don't actually believe in its key functions?<br/>What will be left after the whole crew dismantles their own departments?<br/>Why it's time to return to making millions, billions or bad hamburgers.The world is scourged by narcissists whose rage has been stimulated by charlatans like Donald Trump.Sure, these guys chat about quantum chromodynamics over tea and crumpets.Of course it wasn't Woodstock. There were way more people at Woodstock than at Trump's inauguration. Whole viewing stands completely empty. Trump organizers were on the Metro trying to hand out tickets to prime viewing stands, and yet the stands were still empty. I hope Congress notices how little support Trump has from the public and acts accordingly.<br/>For photos of the empty stands during the parade look here:<br/><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/20/inaugural-parade-crowd-size/96855252/" title="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/20/inaugural-parade-crowd-size/96855252/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/20/inaugu...</a>Mr. Luettgen:<br/><br/>Which do you think will reduce the 780 homicides in Chicago in 2016.<br/>Looser gun safety laws as the NRA and Trump want or stricter gun safety laws that are uniform thru out the US  so that people who get  guns  in states with  lax gun laws can not bring these guns into Chicago.<br/><br/>What were the minimum wage and the unemployment rate when the Bush Great Recession began.<br/>What are these quantities now.First order of business for President P. Grabber the First: signing a decree ending the "disaster" called Obamacare without specifying what exactly would be ending or when exactly it would end or what exactly he'll replace it with (if anything).  But we can all rest assured that by now all violent criminal activity has come to an end- along with all instances of Islamic terrorism- because The Donald has said that it would.  So anyone who now claims that he/she has been beaten up, raped or shot is obviously a liar and should therefore be ignored or prosecuted (or beaten up, raped or shot).  And as soon as he begins to bring home all of the jobs he's outsourced to China, Mexico and Slovenia our new hero of America's working class can start to make good on his promise to bring home all of the jobs that have been outsourced abroad.  If any of this sounds as though it was previously imagined by Lewis Carroll please don't report me to the plagiarism police. It may well be that I fell asleep while watching Mr. Trump fire Latoya Jackson on Celebrity Apprentice and have been dreaming ever since.  Roger, I'm reminded of a scene in "The Lion in Winter."<br/><br/>Prince John: A knife! He's got a knife!<br/>Eleanor: Of course he has a knife, he always has a knife, we all have knives! It's 1183 and we're barbarians! How clear we make it. Oh, my piglets, we are the origins of war: not history's forces, nor the times, nor justice, nor the lack of it, nor causes, nor religions, nor ideas, nor kinds of government, nor any other thing. We are the killers. We breed wars. We carry it like syphilis inside. Dead bodies rot in field and stream because the living ones are rotten. For the love of God, can't we love one another just a little - that's how peace begins. We have so much to love each other for. We have such possibilities, my children. We could change the world."<br/><br/>At the time I saw that play the first time, in the 1960s, the line seemed comic. <br/><br/>In the context of our times it seems prescient and not funny at all. We live in a moment when more of us have decided no longer try to change the world, and maybe even take up war again.<br/><br/>No one can convince me that's progress. Why Northern Ireland and Scotland remain in league with London is a total mystery to me. The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland could enter into an Articles of Confederation agreement, recognizing the Stormont agreement and accommodating it, and abandon ruined England for the EU. Scotland could leave to. <br/><br/>Just because others have kept England from the rocks before doesn't obligate anyone to join them this time.March strong njglea!!!  March for all women who cannot be there except in spirit, I being one of them.  March with all the heart you have shown in your comments supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman who should have been inaugurated Jan. 20, 2017.<br/>That chant of "lock her up" originated with djt and it is disgraceful that Hillary had to endure hearing those words.  But, she is the epitome of a strong woman and my admiration for her has grown ever larger after election 2016.<br/>March with a strong heart njglea and all women who are participating across the USA on Saturday.The lack of attendees along the Inaugural Parade route is striking.

But then again I guess it's kind of fitting that the man who keeps channeling his inner Dickens would have us all sum up today as "it was the best of times (for Trumpians), it was the worst of times (for the rest of us)".@Richard:  Have you actually heard any kids (let alone millions of them) complaining that they can't find jobs because of a raise in the minimum wage?  And "first rung" jobs?  My nephew, a recent college graduate, is already earning about as much at the beginning of his career as I earned at the end of mine.  What those unemployed kids need is a good education (preferably resulting in a college degree and preferably without the backbreaking debt that anyone not born into wealth is likely to be saddled with).  They may also need to pull up stakes and move to an urban center where those first rung jobs are generally to be found.  What they don't need- and don't want- are jobs whose existence depend upon maintaining an unlivable minimum wage.  "Trump was going more for Nuremberg Rally than Woodstock" <br/><br/>Karen, let's be fair =  maybe in view of the Putin connection, the whiff is less of National Socialism than of the Soviet variety.  <br/><br/>One of his first executive orders was for a new Patriots' Day.  He has already expressed his fondness for military parades, Soviet- or North Korean- style, and perhaps sees himself using the day to review the troops and their latest military hardware like the old Soviet leaders at the October Revolution parades.  His mentor Putin, he who turned seamlessly from Communist KGB chief to super-capitalist autocrat, could coach him in details like how to dress for the occasion.  Having never served he couldn't model Stalin's military uniform, but he could project a power-image by going with a heavy winter overcoat à la Brezhnev.  So our Great Leader would pick a cold month for his new date on the calendar - perhaps January 20 to commemorate his swearing in.  <br/><br/>And while he's at it, he might be tempted to rename the part of Pennsylvania Avenue fronting the White House as Red Square, in honor of the color of the political map of the United States, if only by acreage.A little under half of the American population voted for Trump? That's pretty off! <br/><br/>We have a total population of 320 million. Trump got 63 million. Clinton got 65.8 million. 60% of eligible voters actually voted. That remaining 40% of eligible voters who sat home represents another sizable segment of the population.<br/><br/>So no, Trump did not win the votes of a little under half the population of the United States.I saw a few moments of the inauguration this morning, and just before being sworn in watching his face, he did not smile once. One would think someone getting sworn in to be pres would very happy, not him. His smile if has one looks more like a grimace, the mark of a sociopath, unable to smile, laugh at himself, enjoys lording over others, making himself the object of his adoration.<br/><br/>Oh those rusting factories are going to be brought back, like the Packard Plant in Detroit that has been rusting away for years.  Auto assembly line jobs, it no longer takes four people to put the tires on, a robot does that. the jobs will require technical skills those laid off workers do not have.<br/><br/>I worked in a plant that made printed wire boards for F18 radar, it was assembly line work, most of the people were from the lower income parts of town. But I saw them leaving in pretty nice cars at night, and they were happy. Talking to them, I found they had bought an extra home and were renting it out, their kids were going to USC, UCLA , Stanford. They were prepared for the future. That is the antithesis of the Midwest unemployed factory workers, a cultural difference. their kids were not going to follow on the assembly line, they were going to be professionals. They recognized the value of education.<br/><br/>Trump see gloom and doom, he is going to make this a lawful country, I have to remind you, Nazi Germany was a country of laws, any criminal was executed, it did not take much to be a criminal.The unfortunate genius of Trump logic is that today he can paint a dark, haunting vision of America. "Carnage."  If the economy, stock market and immigration rates stay the course, he can turn around and claim that he alone has made "America great again."Socrates - this time it's worse than merely removing solar panels.  As the Times reports elsewhere, the barbarians have begun purging climate data from government records.  Hardware can be replaced.  Data, once lost, cannot.David, trump does actually smile sometimes.  Anyone can put that on; I suspect his smiles are nearly always of the gotcha variety.  I can't remember who it was, but someone quite familiar with trump observed recently that he doesn't laugh, ever. <br/><br/>Kellyanne admonished us to not pay attention to his words but to what's in his heart.  Well, if his expressions of amusement are a window to his heart, it's a very cold one.This morning I saw an unsmiling demagogue telling his followers how bad this country is. That their jobs have been "stolen" by other countries and he will bring them back. That crime is rampant and there is going to be a stop put to it; that he is going to build a wall to keep the border secure; a border that has been one of worlds most peaceful; all to keep those who are willing to take work most Americans won't. <br/><br/>How many Americans do you know who will follow the crops work dawn to dusk and send a few Pesos home? Also when we look around, try and find a stone mason, or a gardener for $75 a month. When I was young it was the Japanese who did that, we knew who the rich were because their shrubs had bonsai trims.<br/><br/>This was not a speech of hope, of how we were going forward, it was how he is going to stop "This American Carnage." What American Carnage? He is going to stop Bangladesh from making cheaper clothing, the Japanese from making good quality cars at good prices. Is he going to bring back Delco that Romney's Bain Capital sold to China, nothing but appeals to prejudice and ignorance. He seems to believe he can alter the law of supply and demand, the mind of a megalomaniac, is now in charge of our country and its law forces, two out of five Americans believe him.<br/><br/>We are now going to see how conservative economics benefits us. Maybe you but not me.

In our opinion, if a wine must be drunk, it will usually be a first-rate Riesling, served chilled (it will warm a little).  With sincere apologies the huge clan of reds, often reported by Eric and others tooo be best-of-class, we began enjoying the dry whites of SW Germany, Alsace and Trier, FR areas many decades ago, and we know where/how to buy what we like.  Far more volume goes into cooking fish and shellfish, but we will drink a little.  When a locally assigned GI meets a local resident who grows grapes, miracles can happen.  Forty-five years later, growing a few (100 acres) of Riesling-suitable" fruit seems to be our thing.  The only wine that we make is processed via 100 or 250 gallon systems, both filled, corked and processed by hand.   The other fruit is sold by weight/volume/bris, all with the understanding that our name man NEVER be used.  It works.  Some years produce world-class wine; others are best kept in the kitchen or cellar.  Partner was born into the grape and wine business; I came only 45 years ago.  In the end, we are grape farmers, not commercial wine makers.  More than 90% of our harvest is sold to others.  Guess who gets the first/last/best of the crop.  And No.  I won't grow the dense reds here.

The US Gov't is messing with social media accounts, and many people will find themselves connected to an account to which they were not previously connected. For example, if someone were a Twitter "follower" of @realdonaldtrump, that user will now find herself following "@POTUS" as well [unless she searches through her "followed" accounts and deletes the one she wishes not to follow]. If someone else had been following "@POTUS" during the Obama Administration, he will now find himself following "@POTUS44" (one of Barack Obama's newly-assigned Twitter accounts); but he will still be following "@POTUS", which will no longer transmit Obama Tweets. There are endless permutations involving Facebook and other services, as well as FLOTUS, VP, VPOTUS, and similar accounts. "Likes", "follows", &amp; similar connections will supposedly be generated.<br/><br/>So I'm just advising: People should check their social media accounts.What doesn't kill democracy strengthens it. <br/><br/>In the long run, Trump's "populism" will lead to a political uprising by We the People that will bury the Republicans and demagogues. <br/><br/>What does Trump know about "carnage?" He who is driven from fancy club to fancy club?  You say Mr. Trump is taking aim at both billionaires and the government.  Knowing that he is planning to eliminate the estate tax, which affects only the truly wealthy and will cut government revenue, somehow I don't see it that way.So definitely not Woodstockian. “In the event we are needed, we certainly will form a wall of meat,” promised Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump,<br/><br/>Ha!<br/>More like Altamont than Woodstock. Except the performers at the Trumpaugural couldn't hold a candle to the Stones. Socrates: Language faux pas. NEVER call him "President" Trump. <br/><br/>Try Con Man Don, or Con Man Donald if you want to show him some respect or pity. But not "President." He'll never live up to the title, no matter how much he rants and raves about how great he is. I can not remember buying anything of quality from Britain lately. Remodeling our kitchen, a Bosch oven, my little coffee grinder, 25 years old, a Braun, my electric shaver a Braun. <br/><br/>We do drive a Buick because i got the factory discount, the previous car was a Toyota, but i do have an F150. I had British cars and motorcycles over the years,they were distinguished by their tendency to leak oil. Somewhere I  have a little essay by someone that describes how English vehicles had to leak oil in order to be able to run. Honda cured that.<br/><br/>A few fossils voted to take Britain out of the EU, hold overs from the 18th century, as in our Midwest red states a dislike of those foreigners who are taking American jobs. Well those jobs and those British jobs are going away, they are going to the rest of the world. they and us will have to pay more for their products, making us poorer, not richer. Wow is right.  There is no way I could have watched.  I thought back 8 years to when I skipped appointments so I could be part of (vicariously at home on my futon) the historic inauguration.  <br/><br/>But today I chose to do something far more satisfying and  useful than watching a racist, misogynist blabbermouth get sworn in.  I went to the animal sanctuary and scooped litter boxes, mopped floors, and played with cats and kittens.Don't let Trump and Company steal your happiness. <br/><br/>Resist. There is joy in it. The Diary of a Young Girl is a banned book? In my community, it was just about required reading for all of us, no matter where we went to school (public, day school, yeshiva). I was actually surprised that Shakespeare and the Tanakh weren't on the banned book list. I suspect that the Christian holy book(s) would be banned too if they weren't most of these people's theological underpinnings.This is also a poker game being played by Trump and his cohorts. The power to essentially do-away-with ACA indeed- can be accomplished by a mere stop in defending the lawsuit: Eliminate the subsidies and the program WILL be destroyed. Trump and Crew  (at least Ryan and Crew) are aware of this. They cannot do this because they have nothing to replace the ACA-with. Open enrollment just ended and folks have selected their plans.<br/>Openly discussing  withdrawing from this appeal- would be enough to cause an economic upheaval not just in the Insurance Markets, but also other markets impacted by health insurance access: Medical Equipment, Hospitals. Transport; Schools who've expanded training programs to accommodate the increase in Medical occupations.  So many ancillary industries and occupations play a part in providing and facilitating health care; the sheer loss would be astounding:<br/>Aside from sheer malice of intent- Ryan and gang aren't stupid. They know what the stakes are, and are not ready to take the fall- if disruption comes too soon.Of course. Get used to it, Americans: we have just elected a con man,<br/>who cannot resist working the suckers as long as he can. Bruni, As good as this is, it is out of date.  It just took a few hours for the women, men, children and babies of America to put Trump in his place as no writer could do. This is the Day that lifted the spirits of the American people.  Women haven't been corrupted as many men haven't either, but it took women of all ages to remind America of what it's about.  Women may have known most clearly the danger of Trump, the unacceptable Trump, and they came out of their doors with the knowledge that it is up to us to protect each other. We reinforced one another as we quietly took to the streets of America.  It was unexpected that a Trump presidency and Republican control of the levers of power would revitalize our country. It was unexpected that millions of us around the world would march today.  Will the Democratic Party get its act together? There are many questions about how we will proceed. While there is much to do, 'Yes, we can!'Putin must have a lot of confidence in his ability to control Trump<br/>considering that he helped put a man into the Presidency who could saturate Russia with doomsday weapons.<br/><br/>Just a thought -- but "Deep Blue" beat the world's best chess player, the best go master, and the best Jeopardy players.  Might a final test be to run the country?Herr Gropenfurher will not be deterred from his self delusions. Sociopaths never are, they are self deceivers, they believe their own exaggerations, they expect others to do so also.<br/><br/>all we can do is target those GOP legislators that let him indulge in his fantasy world. As for Rand, she was right when she said changes in philosophy and ides take 50-100 years. She has been dismissed as a crank, but these people are characters in her books, she saw them coming and they are not her heroic ones, the are scurrilous ones, but the see themselves as the leaders. Trump is very much like her anti hero, James Taggert, a braggart, a poltroon, a coward. <br/><br/>We can set him on a path to self destruction by constantly making fun of him,  putting his pseudo self esteem in the spotlight as being that of a mentally disturbed nothing, letting him know the public detests him. people who can not laugh, are mental midgets.I read this column in total disbelief. The world's only superpower has just elected a man who is totally unfit for the office, who ran a campaign filled with hatred targeted at Hispanics, Muslims, immigrants, and mocked the disabled and takes pride in his disgraceful treatment of and behavior towards women. He makes threats about silencing the press, internet, and television media that dares to criticize him and he just gave an inaugural address where he pointedly did not call for unity.<br/><br/>In Poland and Hungary far wing wing governments have taken over with anti semitism rearing its ugly head with dark similarities to the 1930's.  France might soon elect a far right extremist, and Britain is pulling out of the European Union in large part due to the flow of immigration from the Middle East. <br/><br/>In Syria nearly one million people have been killed and the dictator continues to use chemical weapons against his own people and no one seems willing to stop him.<br/><br/>The Iranians have armed the terrorist group Hezbollah with more than 100,000 missiles targeted at Israeli cities, the government of Israel moves further right and our new President seeks to increase the chances of war between Israel and Iran which Israel's prime minister seems to welcome.<br/><br/>China and America could be involved in a disastrous trade war, and Russia continues to wreak havoc on the world order with apparent help from our new President and is now trying to topple Angela Merkel.<br/><br/>And this may be the best year ever???By that theory, they are gambling with their credibility, hoping it comes out "right" meaning wrong for all of us, so they can say "I told you so" about things they predicted before they could know.<br/><br/>That is not even a claim to credibility after they get lucky.<br/><br/>We need better from the press. Go as far as the evidence takes them, but not further. Don't fear to say what is there, but don't go for speculation as fact, or rumors not chased down.Here is the gist of a comment I made on this column several hours ago. <br/><br/>I think Ross's miss givings are misplaced.I don't think journalists are in danger of falling into a trump imitation game. But they ARE in danger of getting sidelined and trapped by a master manipulator.<br/><br/>At this point it's game on.  Serious journalists will take to heart the fiasco that occurred in trumps first press conference when he had them off balance, dancing while simultaneously insulting them. It was a very poor show.<br/><br/>Unless reputable news media band together and cooperate instead of competing, they will always be on the ropes once Trump has a chance and the time to paint a story. Jim Rutenberg describes their dilemma in the Mediator column of two weeks ago. <br/><br/>The man is dangerous. Journalists underestimate him at their peril. But if ever there was a time when we need the press to hold this man accountable, it's now.<br/><br/>Both sides need each other. Trump wants coverage, and the media want to be first to market with the story. There's a fine line between caution and impulse in the publication game.<br/><br/>But I trust that if reputable media simply do their jobs and follow their internal processes, it should be easier for them to be able to cover Trump honestly and forthrightly.Goodness, Mr. Kristof, you're quite the pollyanna! I congratulate you for your optimism; it's a thousand pities I can't share it.<br/><br/>Global poverty and children's health and lives are, as you note some way down in your essay, not very high on the agenda of the new administration. Just yesterday, in his inaugural address, the new president said "America first!" How does this defiant manifesto of jingoism (delivered in anger with a closed fist) translate into a concern for suffering children anywhere? The new president was more taken with his new hotel in Washington where, surely, the great unwashed would be turned away.<br/><br/>Private American philanthropy aside, Mr. Kristof, the State Department is the agency that is on the front line of international humanitarian aid. The Department of Health and Human Services should be endowed with funds enough for the research and development of medicines that can combat blindness, e.g., not only overseas, but in our very land. <br/><br/>American citizens suffer from these societal ravages. What of the Zika virus? The right-wing Congress refused President Obama's reasonable request for money to combat the virus just last year. Do you think that a Trump administration, interested solely in abolishing the inheritance tax and deregulation of industry and commerce, cares at all about suffering people, whether they are Americans or not?<br/><br/>One can pray that your optimism may be well-grounded, Mr. Kristof. As of yesterday, I have no hope. None.In Trump's mind, the U.S. is falling apart: carnage, crime, drugs, school kids not learning.<br/><br/>Why do some Americans let him get away with this garbage? It won't be long before he imposes protectionism( also mentioned in yesterday's speech) and his supporters suddenly find Wal Mart prices skyrocketing, airline fares escalating because Boeing can't sell their planes and BMW workers in South Carolina are laid off.Thank you so much for helping us to get perspective! We need to be hearing and reading more news like your columns and not just the latest thing that Mr. Trump has done.Thank you for this column.  It helps.  Yes, everything is as terrible as it seems. When it is being reported that Trump has stated he will use Iraq's oil to pay for Americans' social programs. When he has the founder of Blackwater as a close adviser. When Trump makes messianic comments in his inaugural speech -- a few days after Putin applauded him for not being messianic. When an incoming president shakes his fist during his first address to the nation as president -- to mention but the first few things that come to mind. Why then, yes, things are terrible as they seem and then some. But a brighter view is very welcome. Why does everyone, including the NYT, continue to dance around the graveyard? The United States is *over*. There is *no* path to recovery. Please, take your hands off your chests and LOOK and LISTEN.!Dear Polly Anna:  You're considering only ONE species:  Homo sapiens (sic).<br/>     An estimated 30,000 plants and animals are driven extinct annually, almost all caused by human impacts, not normal evolution.  Humans are the most destructive (and only SELF-destructive) species on the planet, to the detriment of all other life forms.  "Wise"?  Hardly.  "Clever," certainly.<br/>Key to all these issues, of course, is gross human overpopulation, which almost NOBODY addresses, fearful of losing funding, no doubt.<br/>RECOMMENDED READING:  Alan Weisman's "COUNTDOWN."<br/>With the Trump ascendancy, America, democracy and the world at large are entering Dark Times, indeed.  Cry, the Beloved Country.Yes, fine, and say that loud and clear. <br/><br/>Don't go past to speculation. Don't spread fears as facts. Stick to facts. They'll be bad enough soon enough, if you're right. <br/><br/>In the meantime, we need clear news, not partisanship as news. That is just fake news from yet another side.The penalties for avoiding enrollment in an insurance plan should have probably been a good deal heftier than the ones that were finally imposed.  Universal health care is the law in virtually every country in the industrialized world, and in virtually every country the costs are far lower than they are in ours.  Too bad that in this instance we truly are an "exceptional" nation. Trump only got about 26% of the vote among eligible voters, so even the percentage of white women who voted for him is small. At today's March in San Francisco, almost a third or more were men.Why would he remove women's right to vote?  Over 50% of white women, and 42% of women in general, voted FOR Trump.  no exclusion here --sf rally thanked male supporters with great enthusiasm.  This march was at least 40% men.Donald Trump is the establishment now.Big deal.  Just like the harassment of the Electoral College: a waste of time.  You just blew an election.  Keep it up, please.Yeah, I couldn't believe still marching about this 40 years later....I don't believe a single thing that Dean Baquet says about the 2016 coverage.  The Times has been after the Clintons for 25 years.  Isn't it about time that you owned up to it?  Remember Whitewater?  I'm still waiting to see the apology for that.<br/><br/>Not one of your readers buys into the hand-wringing act about wanting to publish the dossier  but just couldn't.  "While his findings were difficult to confirm, Times reporting bore out that he was respected in his craft. And of his material that was checkable, no significant red flags emerged."  Maybe you don't think that corrupt ties to a foreign power are newsworthy, yet the chance that a foreign power might hack someones personal email is.  That's crazy.  Or it would be if you didn't have a strong bias about what to report.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the ludicrous Comey allegations commanded the front page for days.  Let us review them, shall we?   To be new news, the email downloaded from a server had to be different from what was on the server. That is, of course, impossible--  but the Times found it credible. Email neither to nor from Hillary Clinton had to somehow implicate her in some terrible wrongdoing that her own emails did not.  Not impossible, but vanishingly unlikely.  And yet the Times found it credible.  <br/><br/>You need to admit that the Hillary stories were only publishable because your purpose was to harm her candidacy, and that the Trump allegations weren't for the same reason.  You got her, take a victory lap.Cancel my subscription!I canceled mine yesterday due to the utter failure of the NYT in their watchdog capacity re Trump.  The operator said "you're not the only one who feels this way." During the summer and autumn of 2016, daily, and in vain, I searched reliable news sources like The New York Times for more about the Trump-Putin connection. It seemed there had to be more, and I couldn't understand why no one was pursuing the story.I think it is hard to avoid the conclusion that not publishing the entire dossier  was inexcusable, rather than irresponsible.   How is it ethical that the FBI was investigating, official Washington was chattering, but the press decided to keep it secret from voters?  Journalistic "ethics" are clearly overdue for a major re-examination.  Sadly ironic to see this column followed on my digital news by the Times plea, Got a confidential tip?  Imagine the slush pile of tips that go unreported.  A truly disheartening portrait, and today we inaugurate the consequences. The Times did essentially the same thing to Al Gore in '99-'00. If Al Gore had gotten elected there would have been no Iraq invasion/occupation and we'd be among the countries leading the way in fighting climate change and clean energy deployment. Now we'll go backward for another 4 years on CO2 mitigation. The 8 years of Bush admin climate change denial may have determined the fate of humanity.<br/><br/>When push comes to shove, you guys have done your utmost to put your finger on the scale to help elect 2 of the worst presidents in US history. <br/><br/>What the heck are you thinking?The most frustrating part of this piece is the continued equivocating. I wonder if today's editors would have published the Pentagon Papers.  Likely not.  Some kind of journalist ideal put before a moral imperative.  The editors should feel complicit in the results of this election....this while it was quite obvious that Hillary was being witch hunted.<br/>You can ask Kevin McCarthy....he'll explain.I've been thinking about cancelling my subscription ever since election night. How could NYT have been so wrong? After reading this it convinces me that cancelling my NYT subscription is what I need to do. It seems to me complacent executive editorial liberal thinking also caused a hugely important story to be suppressed. And I'm not convinced the gusto necessary to keep up with Trump bullying and bait and switch tactics is there. Whatever happened to hard-hitting investigative journalism? When I see it again, I will come back. Then and only then.A repeat of the Times support for the invasion of Iraq - and intelligence claims about WMD that justified it - followed by similar support for the war on Libya and Syria. Is this a semi-apology for the constant anti-Russian tone from the Times columnists and reporters. It the time now for friendship and cooperation between countries with different systems of government. Peace before hostility  and the wars that follow from it.Finally some acknowledgment from the times of the inadequacy of the reporting on this issue. I have written to the editors several times about this as I'm sure have many, many other NY Times subscribers.  But really, this falls into the category of too little, too late. The Times should be ashamed, absolutely ashamed, of its coverage of the trump, Russia connection.Where is the editorial denouncing Trump's inaugural address, lie by lie, outrage by outrage? Someday we may learn why cowardice prevailed on the Newspaper of Record at a crucial moment in American history. Until then, let's see some gutsy journalism starting now. Maybe the Times should hire some fresh talent to repair the damage its irresolution has caused.The problem is timing, and impact on the election. Comey came out with an entirely bogus claim of a re-opened investigation of Hillary's emails, ten days before the election. There was no evidence to support that claim, but the NYT reported it, and everyone agrees that the reporting of tjis bogus claim hurt Hillary significantly. By holding back on reporting more substantial claims of Trump's nefarious ties to Russia, the NYT portrayed Hillary as dirty, and Trump as clean, while the opposite is true. The NYT and its media cohorts helped elect a dangerous charlatan, and did serious damage to a noble, worthy presidential candidate. Shame on you, I hope you can't sleep. I'm really shocked by this.  Dean Baquet protests angrily that they didn't "sit on stuff."  But, it appears, they did.  Investigations are reported all the time, even when it turns out that there was nothing there.  That's basically been the story of Hillary Clinton's life.  And, we're treating this walking scandal of a man with kid gloves -- breathlessly reporting that the FBI's outrageous last-minute Hillary email business that had nothing to it, and covering up that the FBI is investigating Trump about more serious matters?  How can the Times justify this double standard?  The article is polite about it, but it seems outrageous to me.Thank you, Liz Spayd, for a strong and courageous piece of ombudsmanship for Times' readers. It cannot have been easy for you to write your piece knowing The Times' management would be looking at every word.<br/><br/>I too as a Clinton supporter can lament the fact that Baquet didn't publish these Russian connection stories before the election but as a reader I can also understand if the Russian story's sources had proven false what we'd be saying about Baquet today. <br/><br/>What I want to thank The New York Times for is paying you to do such work as displayed in this column. Regardless of what I think of Baquet's decision, I, for sure, can support his newspaper's ombudsmanship.And why is this Public Editor mea culpa located in very small print at the bottom of the page?Elijah Cummings today on CNN:<br/>"You’ve got to understand that we members of Congress have a lot of information that the public does not have. And I can tell you over the last week or two, the classified briefings that I have been to, and if the public knew what members of Congress know..."<br/><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/01/20/1622716/-One-Rep-s-Ominous-Warning-About-Trump-If-The-Public-Knew-What-Congress-Knows" title="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/01/20/1622716/-One-Rep-s-Ominous-Warning-About-Trump-If-The-Public-Knew-What-Congress-Knows" target="_blank">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/01/20/1622716/-One-Rep-s-Ominous-Warn...</a><br/>Before this is "over" you guys will look worse than you do today.So the FBI not only withheld information on Trump's investigation but also discouraged the media from reporting on it? Did the FBI also discourage the media from reporting on Hillary's investigation? I almost just renewed --- This is why I find myself abandoning the Times for the Washington Post more and more these days.The reporting was like a repeat of that before the Iraq war. The Times supported the invasion and the fiction about WMD. After an apology it went on to support "regime change" in Libya and Syria. The results are horrendous. The present article may - hopefully -  be the preface for a new apology in relation to Russia. The world need friendly relations between the major powers and not assumptions of intellectual and moral superiority.This is the part that jumped out at me: "In each instance, it was the actions of government officials that triggered newsroom decisions — not additional reporting or insight that journalists gained." <br/><br/>Why do you have reporters if they aren't able to find out anything? Especially the newspaper in Trump's home base. He's a real estate businessman who has worked in the area for years, and no one has information about him? Unbelievable! <br/><br/>One of the ongoing problems with NYT has been clickbait-oriented titles (written by editors!) that are not supported by the stories they lead into. There wasn't a failure of reporting--there was a failure of leadership at the Times. The editors failed their readers. Why do the mea culpas always seem to be too little, too late with the Times?  The Times aggressively joined in every Republican PR initiative of the past 20 years, from hounding the Clintons over Travelgate, Filegate, Whitewater, etc. during the '90s, to hazing Al Gore over wearing earth tones and sighing during a debate, to buying into every Bush administration lie about Saddam's supposed WMDs and support for terrorism, to now making a phony issue over Hillary Clinton's emails the central issue of the campaign while downplaying much more serious ethical issues with Donald Trump, Russia and his family "charity."  The Republicans have gotten away with murder on your watch.  Can it really be an accident that it keeps happening over and over, and the apologies always come too late to matter?You bastards. You have failed us mightily.<br/><br/>Get off your lazy ------ and get busy going after the regime quite literally while you still have the chance to do so. Lives literally depend on it. Stop counting your ad revenue, worrying about your stock price and your compensation packages, and start focusing intensely on the stark reality that is aimed at us all. NOW. DO IT. Don't come back to this same space with another sorry apologia when it's too late, sadly it may already be.It's not free trade when the countries you are dealing with have different regulations, laws, government minimum wage standards, and fiat currency manipulation standards.  Those things are by definition not free trade.  I haven't even gotten into slaves, dictatorships, and sweat shops (see minimum wage standards). <br/><br/>This type of "free trade" was a trojan horse designed to strangle a country with it's own rules and regulations, by ignoring one side of the equation.I'm not against that at all. It's just that most Americans most don't buy a few good, well made pieces of clothing at higher prices. We are conditioned to buy new stuff, relatively cheaply, constantly because it fuels the economy. The fashion industry makes sure we want the "latest" style in order to have us buy new things. We are a nation of shoppers because it keeps our economy going.  I'm just bringing up  the cheaper imports because it's a problem for the American mindset - perpetual consumers to not buy the latest style - and, a problem for the economy. Built in obsolescence is good for profit.Bingo. You are spot on, but how would it affect the economy built on perpetual consuming? Or China....China is the third in the world in patent applications. It is catching up very rapidly to the US. Fundamentally, it also has a population of 1.3 billion. At some point, it is a basic fact it will be a larger consumer market than the US. <br/><br/>To some extent TPP was an attempt to dictates the terms of trade relations with those members while the US still holds the keys. I won't say TPP was perfect, but the idea that we should just tear up TPP and we will "win" (to use Trump's phrase) is pretty doubtful. Talk about breathless sensational reporting lets all stand and give Peter Baker a hand.  On the News Hour tonight Chuck Schumer while being interviewed by Judy Woodruff stated, its been dead for a while now, congress has not approved it, so what Trump did doesn't matter. What say you to that NYTs? Not to mention that neither party would have supported it at this point when a vast majority of Americans reject corporations writing bills that put their profit over citizens rights.Always thought it should be Mary O. Blige.My family is Boomer parents and Gen X kids and spouses. My wife and I loved Los Angeles, where we spent collectively over a hundred years of our lives. We would be there still but for health reasons, for the energy, the excitement, the culture, the ocean, the kaleidoscope of humanity, the constant innovation. Only health forced us out in the end. We still live in a city, in a way--in a suburb of a substantial city in Northern California, not the Bay Area. It is better for us as we are. But we miss the LA we knew so much, but we are no longer the people able to enjoy what it offers.<br/><br/>Our youngest daughter and her husband are about to have their first child. They are desperate to leave the Bay Area, as they cannot imagine trying to raise a child in San Francisco. Our middle daughter long ago left Los Angeles, and lives in a remote area in the Western U.S. with her husband, even though they are childless; they are athletic, love the outdoors, and found urban living confining. Our oldest daughter is also about to leave LA for the South, as she can no longer handle the traffic, the noise, the general unpleasantness of every day living.<br/><br/>For them, it has nothing to do with money, but quality of life. Their struggles, and the nostalgia my wife and I have for what passes for urban living in California, and this article tell me one thing: we are in a period of enormous flux. And the recent election will only magnify the uncertainties. <br/><br/>New Zealand, anyone?usa puts cost of healthcare on the profit side of the balance sheet  hence all the excessive costs  what does that do to our competitiveness in this global economy  should be of the cost side of the ledger where it is everywhere else in the world developed and non developed  Major problems with the website (desktop user), weird loading issues, no information or links, solved puzzle not showing.

It always strikes me odd to clue teams to cities when they move around at the whim of capitalists and have no real connection to the "home" town they supposedly represent (when mostly what they do is drain the public coffers building their palaces).

Personally, I believe that a fair, bi-lateral agreement with someone who actually believes in hassel-free international shipping lanes is a better way to go. But, that's just me.Patria/Country. Patriotism/love of country. Putting America first does not mean reducing our influence in the world but using that influence to benefit ourselves first so that we can remain the light to which the rest of the world is drawn and the beacon by which they are guided. It takes great wealth and power for us to occupy that position. A weakened America whose wealth has been redistributed around the globe cannot remain its vibrant center. No, the dollar has gotten significantly stronger since Trump was elected because currency traders expect the trade deficit to go down. Google "DXY chart" for a graph of Dollar Index Futures to see this. <br/><br/>Trump's policy of reducing China's bilateral trade surplus with the US is most definitely a strong dollar policy. If a country runs a trade deficit, it must issue additional currency to pay for foreign goods. Dumping more currency in the markets, weakens one's own currency. Basic supply and demand.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if Trump could (?) bring more manufacturing back to the US  that would, in fact, slow the rise of China relative to the US. Since China exports $20-30 billion more to the US than we sell to China, China will be the big overall loser in a trade war with the United States, even if some companies would of course lose out. <br/><br/>Finally, TPP has absolutely nothing to do with China's rise. China is rising because America handed over to China its best technology, and because America finances China's rise by allowing China to run a trade surplus against the US. China has also used the money we have given them to buy up key natural resources in Africa and buy influence in our South American backyard. TPP is irrelevant to all this. <br/><br/>Note well: we kept the Soviets out of Latin America (ex Cuba) and kept our technology away from them. Those are big reasons why the US won the Cold War. By doing the opposite, we are losing to China now. Why is racism seen in every issue?? --<br/>Because this is AMERICA......And Trump's all-White male cabinet looks nothing like it -- or, maybe you just didn't notice it because they all look like you.<br/>Another thing.<br/>The President of the United States is supposed to represent ALL Americans, remember?<br/>This would've been a good place to start.Even though I am not a Trump supporter, I felt this article was written unfairly to demonize him as everything else I read today fairly stated that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders did not support the TPP either, and it was not able to be passed in Congress (briefly mentioned), it had essentially already failed....this would of happened no matter who was elected.@Alan Grossberg, We are producing more with fewer people in the agricultural sector, too.<br/><br/>Large landowners, many of them corporations of one type or another, are able to plow fields without anyone even driving the machinery because of GPS and self-driving technology. Farmer John, who in the time of the Founding of Our Nation represented more than 50% of the population, is now down to less than 5% and there's plenty of food being produced. Farmer John is a programmer now.Don't you remember Trump saying during the campaign: "I love the poorly educated" ??? --- Now you know why.Reality check globilzation has done nothing but poluted other countrys an many cases caused child labor .No reason we cant make what we cumsume an live with in our own means.As for china would be better off to live with in its own means too. People may not like truth hurts an there will be alot lest waste poluting oceans.No. The joke is going to be on the people who voted for him.<br/>Just wait...this is only the beginning."But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward, and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond."<br/><br/>Obama and the multinationals had all the time in the world to write a clean bill but no. They had to lard with all manner of corporate malfeasance creating patently ridicules law that only a crook could support in the light of day. <br/><br/>Language like this "declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades," do not help on any front.<br/><br/>Fact is the PPT was doomed the moment it emerged from the back room where it was created.Hillary once called TPP the gold standard of trade deals. But in your example...after the storm, the bananas which Australia protects with tariffs, returned to NORMAL PRICES.He overestimated his own bargaining power.Yes it does, I bet the list came from some educated people and he will only select one with further advice.  Unlike Obama he is not the smartest person in the room.  For example when he fixed the skating rink, he found the best to do that and then let them perform.  He investigated or had his staff do so.   This is how people in business  do things.My mistake with the quotation about sales of 1984 in my previous comment, this is the story relating to very recent increases in sales of this novel ...<br/><br/>'Sales are soaring for George Orwell's "1984" in the wake of incorrect or unprovable statements made by President Donald Trump and some White House aides. <br/><br/>Orwell's classic dystopian tale of a society in which facts are distorted and suppressed in a cloud of "newspeak" was in the top 5 on <a href="http://Amazon.com" title="Amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> as of midday on Tuesday. '<br/><br/><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/25/1984-sales-soar-alternative-facts-trump-claims-echo-orwells/" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/25/1984-sales-soar-alternative-facts-trump-claims-echo-orwells/" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/25/1984-sales-soar-alternative-f...</a>They would if they could. Republicans want to run these guys through fast and have cut off further questioning. All the Democrats can expect to do is inform the public what they themselves see and know, which contrasts how perfect and smart they are, according to Trump. Gag orders preventing further discussion of Trump will be issued soon. I think the people are just now beginning to wake up to the fact that they are the victims of a successful coop d'état.Ivanka and Jared just had a hearty laugh. Donald doesn't laugh - at all. But the very last thing he cares about is goodwill. But "bold steps" he is planning on making. None of it will inspire goodwill.What most people are "aghast" about is the flagrant abuse of power and anti-constitutional tactics the Republican Congress used to "ignore" Judge Garland's nomination while Mr. Obama was the standing president, for no other reason than to wait out his presidency.  For the people who voted for Obama, it was the SUPREME middle finger.   We all know what the conservatives wanted when they failed to do their constitutional duty, and thanks to former President Obama's grace, he didn't use the powers he had to force Judge Garland down your throats.  You do know that he, legally, of course, could have.  But he did not, because that's the kind of decent man he is.  So now, yes, you WILL win.  YAYYY for you.  You will succeed in placing a "bought and paid for" right-wing lackey on the Supreme Court, under specious circumstances,  for one reason only, to serve your SELFISH political aims.  The US Constitution be damned.   You all knew what you are doing, and you can trust me,  WE WILL NEVER FORGET.I voted for Bernie and think Trump is a dangerous megalomaniac.<br/>I personally know one of these three, and am aware of no reason why he should not be confirmed. He is a fair judge, an insightful jurist, and a good man.Republicans refused to confirm Judge Garland and Democrats now appear ready to reject any Trump appointee. Whatever happened to " when they go low, we go high"? In 2013 Democrats employed the "nuclear option" eliminating the filibuster for appointees to cabinet positions and judicial appointments below the Supreme Court. Now Republicans have the same option. This tit for tat is deplorable and neither party will have clean hands in this fight which mirrors the awful divisive nature of our current politics. Can no one rise above this bitter partisan divide?McConnell said the people should be heard. The majority voted for Clinton.  So, what's the problem, Mitch?Is there any doubt it will be Judge Pryor.  Trump has big bills to pay with donors, Evangelicals, and his alt-right base.  But more to the point, Trump has scores to settle with those who oppose him: Pryor will be his kick-in-the-teeth revenge.He's got a JD, he was a US Attorney. Since when does Trump care about qualifications? Carson? DeVos? Perry? Kushner? Bannon? Nada. Zilch. Puppets to do biddings of the right christian extremists. Giuliani got a bone tossed to him, finally, and Christie still needs his pay off. And he's out of a job in NJ after this term ends this fall. So he needs a new gig.<br/><br/>But no, Christie isn't going to get it, it's just that Trump likes batting him around like a half-dead mouse. For the foreseeable future justices will be confirmed only when the President and the Senate majority are of the same party.  Trump will get the Scalia seat, and odds are good that at least one of the four liberal seats will be picked up.  It's also possible that Kennedy and/or Thomas will retire, allowing for the appointment of younger conservatives.Ricky:  <br/><br/>At the press conference today Spicer was asked about this.  He said that trump still owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners - but then minimized the implication of that by saying it was only a "couple of thousands of dollars" that he owned - and that was nothing for a "billionaire".  <br/><br/>And you're exactly right - we have no idea what if anything trump sold. Personally I don't think he truly felt he was going to win the election and that coupled with his refusal to divest himself now - I find it not believable that he sold his stock holdings in June.  <br/><br/>If he did sell all his stocks - why is his press secretary now stating he owns some shares in ETP.  Since we have no information, it's impossible to know just how large an investment he does have in ETP.They are all strong decisions agreed to by a prior majority of the Supreme Court and are res judicata. Disregarding them is alternative justice.The reason Medicare exists is precisely because there is no business model that works for providing insurance for the elderly.  Who would be dumb enough to write health insurance for someone in their 80s?<br/><br/>The insurance companies have passed off the loss leaders to the taxpayers and kept the profitable market for themselves.  (So actually single payer would also save Medicare as well, but stupid people would believe the insurance companies, so it's impossible. )<br/><br/>But, this isn't because they are evil or something, it's how it has to work in a free market, which is why Arrow proved the free market can't provide health care efficiently.The seat is not "Scalia's Seat"; he lost it when he died. There is no requirement to fill it with a Scalia's clone. I support Merrick Garland for the VACANT seat.Going high when he goes low is not very effective against Trump.  Going high looks like weakness.  People tune it out.  Going high leaves Trump supporters with their opinions and attachments.  Going low does not work either, since he is the master of low and, more important, going low is not a good way to make important decisions.  <br/><br/>Some who do not like Trump are going humorous, but the humor should be more than just cheap shots.  It should strip away pretense and reveal the reality behind it.  Cheap shots about hair or hands should be a part of a routine that provokes thought or realization as well as laughter.  <br/><br/>We have decided to do an experiment with ourselves, to try something else.  We should not be as concerned with blocking the parts of this experiment as we are with making sure that its results are widely known and not hidden.  Since part of our experiment is to hide reality behind giant steaming mounds of alternate facts, revealing the absurdity of these giant steaming mounds will cut away at their effectiveness.   At the present rate, the Dems are going to sorely miss your dime.When Democrats keep harping about garland, GOP should remind them of the disgraceful way they treated Robert Bork.<br/><br/>As for their unrelenting opposition, It was obstructionism when the other party did it.........When Scalia was alive, there were three who almost always voted together, Scalia, Thomas, Alito.  There were four who ALWAYS voted together on controversial issues on a purely partisan basis, those appointed by Democrats.  And then there were two, Kennedy and Roberts, who no one ever knew how that were going to vote until after the decisions were read.  The Roberts court was never a 5/4 court.  It was a 3/2/4 court.  It is now a 2/2/4 court.<br/><br/>Name a single controversial case where one of the partisan Democrats ever voted with the four or five Republican appointed justices.  <br/><br/>Garland is not a moderate or centrist.  Had Garland been confirmed, the partisan "living constitution" wing would have block voted every single controversial issue.  Had Trump's election been challenged, they'd have given it to Hillary because she had the popular plurality.  If you look at Garland's record, he has never, ever voted to constrain the executive branch.<br/><br/>The judiciary, in general, is expected to grant deference to the elected branches of government on political choices.  Although I disagreed with Robert's on the ObamaCare decision, in his decision he said that it was up to the legislature to cure the obvious defects in the law, not for the judiciary to substitute their judgement.<br/><br/>But we are dependent on the judiciary to point out when the executive branch, rather than executing the law as written, writes new rules unilaterally.  Garland has never done that.WGN led the TV news with this story. A group of about 50 blacks on the South Side said the only thing that will help is bringing in the National Guard. And these are the people who live in the middle of the chaos. <br/><br/>But if you think Chicago is all hunky-dory with 42 murders by January 24, then OK!! Tell that to the people who aren't delighted with living in the midst of Murderville. if the senate regains a democratic majority in 2018, would you be okay with them blocking any of his appointments until the next election?<br/><br/>because that's what the republicans did this time around. remember, you reap what you sow.The same should be said of Merrick Garland, whose nomination was stonewalled by #RepublicantsMuch like Merrick Garland?Congratulations to those who selected Hilary as the Democrat candidate; Many of us saw this train coming long ago.I would be appalled if Democrats do not fight tooth and nail over this nomination.  Republicans committed a political crime last year right in plain public view, and if Democrats do not have a proportional response then they will effectively be rolling over and signalling to the Republicans that they can do the same thing again and again.  It will cause permanent institutional damage to both the Senate and the Supreme Court.In California many work for labor contractors that hire out to agricultural companies. Many of them live with relatives in places like Salinas. the bus picks them up, takes them to the fields, the get paid by the amount they harvest, the contractor collects from the farmer, he pays the workers. Without these workers the east coast would not get many products from the fields. They have to work hard and fast to make enough to pay rent and send some home. <br/><br/>We see comment here all the time as to how Americans would do the jobs if paid better, showing ignorance of the work and travel required. When one crop is harvested, they have to move on to another, strawberries and apples ripen at different times and in different places, as do the truck crops in Imperial county. My gardener had five crews until a couple of years ago but the undocumented ones left. They spent, bought pickups, groceries, clothing, electronics, all contributing to the economy. My uncle had an apricot farm, he had to tear out the trees when he could not pickers any more. <br/><br/>A lot of those affordable tract homes were built by them, that was what made them affordable. People complained about the illegals, but bought the homes. Now isn't that hypocritical?Note how with all this talk of a wall Mexico does not say anything about the problem that so many of its citizens illegally enter our country, or do anything to stop it. <br/><br/>I have heard talk of a wall (usually called a fence) on the Mexico border since Bill Clinton ran on that platform in 1992. Eight and then four years ago Mitt Romney often talked about the need for a fence to finally control our southern border. Congress even passed the Secure Fence Act of 2008 which was supposed to finally secure our border. It was partly built (and of course partly doesn't help). <br/><br/>But now somehow when Donald Trump does get serious about building a wall that is terribly offensive to the Mexican people? <br/><br/>I can understand how this puts Enrique Pena Nieto in a bind, and wish there were some way to soften the blow. And Donald Trump should not keep saying that Mexico is going to pay for the wall -- of course they are not and that's a low blow that helps no one. <br/><br/>But I cannot see why the Democrats in the United States think that we should allow people and goods to illegally cross our southern border, and that people who are in our country illegally should be allowed to stay. I applaud Donald Trump's actions. <br/><br/>And I hope that Enrique Pena Nieto does show up. I think a dialogue between the two men will help a lot. Donald Trump tweets like a tiger and signs documents that are harsh. But in person he is more of a pussycat. (As Mitt Romney found out.) The wall is a giant prop in Trump's political theater. And the show is all he cares about.Are you OK then with a open border from Mexico allowing poor immigrants who's offspring would automatically become US citizens using our tax money to pay for their hospital services. How do you justify illegal immigration into our country where I've read Mexico deports any illegals caught into Mexico the same day?.Why would Pena Nieto allow himself to be used, once again, as a prop by the Trump campaign.  Does the man never learn?? Trump is not interested in a dialogue with him.  Trump could care less what Nieto says to him.  The sole purpose of this meeting is so that Trump can stand beside the Mexican president while he trashes Mexico and Mexican-American immigrants in an effort to appease his rabid, racist base.  Oh right, that's certainly true because agent 777 tells us.  The U.S. should just dispense with all trade agreements entirely and rely only on what we produce locally!  It's always worked before, right?  Yup, gotta listen to Truth when it comes with a lucky number and a vast array of statistics to back the claim up.and Elke<br/>No problem getting to print out on A-L tonight. I am west of MISSOURI.<br/>On first run through puzzle got all the way down to (CROW)N ROYAL before I got a "hit". By coincidence, my blue felt bag holds my birding binoculars and a Golden Field Guide "Birds of North America". Both well used.<br/>Then I worked my way back to get BAL(LOON)IST and FRA(TERN)ITY. Did need aid on TE LA(WREN)CE .<br/>Agree with MTFTobin-  would not consider LOONs, TERNs or even CROWs "LITTLE BIRDIES".  I mentioned yesterday hummingbirds- they are LITTLE; so are "t*ts"  and chickadees, and, yes, WRENs.<br/>GEE, THO , on the other hand, CROWs have been caught trying to talk, so in keeping with the  theme ....<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ0yrG-Yz88" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ0yrG-Yz88" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ0yrG-Yz88</a><br/><br/>I continue to be AMAZED at the clever themes  with which puzzle constructors come up .  This one certainly was UPTEMPO and FINE.<br/>Now for some ice cream in a CUP  to celebrate catching on to a rebus early.<br/><br/>PS- deadline- glad you're back. A speedy recovery.Well, Trump has already assured himself a legacy...<br/><br/>"Monument to lies" is an epic way of describing the wall. Should the useless (hello ladders and tunnels) wall survive, future generations will actually be writing on it all the lies a US President once told Americans. I'm pretty sure Trump can continue mouthing off and fill the entire 2,000 miles. <br/><br/>Not that any of this should have surprised us. Politico had done an analysis based on hours of statements and confirmed that Trump lies every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>One of his biggest whoppers: "Mexico will 'pay' for the wall. 100%" which apparently is now "through a complicated mechanism and utilizing different definitions of payment, Mexico will 'contribute' to the wall". (Paul Ryan and Trump)<br/><br/>Yet another version of "Alternative facts"...Trump, unelected by the the majority of voters in the United States, is a fraud, a liar and a disaster.  Forced to deal with an irrational, narcissistic leader (Trump), even Mexico is now taking a hard line with the U.S.  I wonder what new "executive order" Mr. Trump will sign tomorrow?  Less than a week into his administration, he has shown his strategy to remain in office - pander to big business - but offer no substance; abuse the power of his office by calling for an investigation into "fraudulent voting", but don't investigate Russian hacking.  The emperor truly has no clothes.  Small hands.  Big lies.  Totally embarrassing.  You're fired!!If Trump and his supporters are so sure that Mexico will pay for the wall, i suggest the government issue bonds to finance the wall, payable solely out of funds collected from Mexico. Supporters/believers can purchase the bonds and the rest of us who object to the whole idea can watch. Mr. President, if you are so sure Mexico will pay, here's your chance to step up and walk the walk. We're watching."Ok, Mexico, here's the deal. We buy a sombrero and a blanket for 20 billion. You pay 20 billion for a wall."<br/>"Well, Senior Trump, you drive a very hard bargain, but we could consider that if you let our people supply the labor."<br/>"Deal."<br/>"Senior Trump, you are the toughest negotiator we have ever dealt with. You have humbled us and put us in our place." Mr. Pena Nieto should cancel his meeting and be the first world leader to refuse to be bullied. No dignity in the office when there is no dignity in the man. Trump will turn our great country into a laughingstock. Well, I would.Remember the Alabama anti-illegals legislation of a year or so ago? It was very quietly repealed within a month after passing when Alabama's agri-business couldn't get enough "legal" laborers to do the scut work entailed in growing food for America's tables.<br/><br/>I suspect Alabama is NOT an isolated case.<br/><br/>See also: the restaurant business, the hospitality industry, the apparel industry, etc.<br/><br/>Cheap goods and low wage labor have a cost.<br/><br/>And elections have consequences...American workers have no choice- Trump has said he will make them pay for it. And they will, because they can't afford to have been wrong about Trump.After all the nationalistic, populistic rhetoric and pomp fed to the electorate, the American consumer is the ultimate underwriter and payor of a tax arriving in the form of higher priced imported goods, in exchange for nothing more than a colossal monument to the massive ego of a narcissistic ninny.We need border security. Whether or not Mexico pays for the wall, we need to be able to control our borders.<br/>Trump campaigned on this issue.  This is not a surprise to anyone.I get The Trump Factor and how his boorish behavior is similar to that of a persistent bad smell.<br/>But if millions of people have illegally entered a country in contravention of that countrie's immigration laws, doesn't that country have the right to take a stance to attempt to stop it? How is protecting one's border "an offense to Mexico"<br/>I understand being insulted by Trump's innapropriate and false accusations towards Mexicans and the expectation to make them pay for the wall but not the building of a wall. Are walls and fences that are currently existing insulting too or  are only new walls insulting? If the borders are not going to become totally open then reinforcing it might not be a bad thing.The Mexican prez has done the right thing. I am flying to Mexico next week to look at property.  I am disgusted with my country.The left has a large part in bringing about the atrocity that is President Trump.<br/>I do not agree with his plan to build a wall.  I also don't agree that people who overstay their visas or cross the border illegally have the right to be considered American citizens.  I live in Seattle currently and our mayor constantly goes on social media making it clear that anyone who does not believe in treating illegal immigrants as legal citizens is unacceptable.  He uses words such as diversity and inclusion in ways that don't make sense.  The left accuses the right of using dog whistles and racial code words yet the left has consistently used words like diversity, inclusion, racial equity, racism, xenophobia, and sexism in ways that are inherently dishonest and make it taboo to object to their policies.  A few weeks ago our mayor pledged a quarter of a million dollars earmarked specifically for the illegal immigrant community.  Why are nationals of other countries in America illegally subject to more sympathy and taxpayer funded programs than legal residence?<br/>It is infuriating.  If most of these people came from countries where they risk death if they return I would be more compassionate but Mexico is not that bad.  Shame on Trump and those who elected him and shame on the left for such tone deaf policies that drove people to vote for him.The aside from everything else, the wall has environmental implications for migrating animals.So far Trump has insulted Mexico and China and has probably provoked more instability in the Middle East with his intent to move our embassy to Jerusalem and withdraw from the multi-nation agreement with Iran.<br/>And Trump supporters think we are now more secure?No. It's missing quite a few things. One of them being subtlety and the other a point.Tremendous cost with little in return, how about that for a start?  Most illegal immigrants, come in on a visa and then overstay.   The wall will do nothing to prevent this.  It is also a symbol of racism and hatred to our neighbor to the south.  They are our third largest trading partner,  a relationship that has benefits to both sides.  <br/><br/>What if Mexico decides enough insults.  Maybe they should form a tighter relationship with China.  China thinks that would be a great idea to start expansion into the Northern Hemisphere with their new friend China.  <br/><br/>A wall is a stupid idea.  Read up on this before thinking this is just about a wall.@El Lucho What will Republicans do? They will institutionalize their party's governance by restricting access to the ballot box and gerrymandering opposition into a permanent minority. They will impose high political costs on unfavorable reportage ano criticism against them. When necessary, security forces will be used toTrump wants to be the King and tries to manage the US Government like he manages his Trump enterprises; with authoritarian style with few unimpactful advisers.  It costs him nothing if he blows the US economy, trade partner relationships or blows trillion dollars to unnecessary stimulation.  The tax payors will carry the burden.  This is a cluster fudge where the majority of voters do not support Trump.  How to stop him is to ensure that Democrats have the majority.  We can't do much about his shot-gun executive orders.Oh, those tax and spend Republicans!I'm sorry, but I'm a bit confused.  How can it be said that a tariff on imports is paid by the exporter?  As I understand the model, the exporter in another country enters into a contract to sell goods to the importer in the U.S.  The price of the goods is at the factory door.  Shipping and customs clearance are the responsibility of the importer.  The customs agent looks at the goods and the documentation and determines the price is X and the duty is 20%, payable by the importer.  The importer then the price of the goods in the domestic market at cost of the goods (X) + duty (0.2X) + shipping + local costs + profit.<br/><br/>Everything beyond X is the responsibility of the importer, not the exporter.  So how does the duty come out of the exporter's pocket?Something scares me about this logic: imposing tariffs so no one wants to buy products from Mexico, thereby hurting Mexico's economy, and what if that strong armed Mexico into paying for... a wall?<br/><br/>It feels outlandish, but then again that Aetna-Obamacare thing actually happened.Note also that if cheaper goods are imported from somewhere else  they will not be subject to the 20% tariff, and thus will not raise the funding the tariff was intended to raise."Dont they see the Emperor has no clothes?"<br/><br/>Of course they do, and they will never admit it, because it will show them to be spineless sycophants that we all know they are.A waste of good taxpayer money, and with fewer jobs in Mexico as a result, more people will want to come over/under/around the wall.  “Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. We have no choice."<br/><br/>Tough guy. Let's see him say that to Putin.This guy is going to send the US economy into a tail spin! Not feeling good about my investments or the future. And I am not alone. He is frightening. The worst President imaginable.You know, I love the NYT's readers- such analytic and educated good folk.  But let's face it, to analyze Trump's plans, tweets, orations, tantrums, fantasies and delusions is tantamount to trying to construct rational thought from a schizophrenic- it can't be done.  This is also why we don't try people suffering from said disease in a court of law- it is not only unfair to the diseased- it's unfair to the victims.<br/><br/>And yet we (them) made this man president of the United States of America.So, American consumers have to pay for this wall. Do Trump supporters agree that they should pay a 20% tax on such goods from Mexico like food?The wall is a terrific idea!  It doesn't matter who pays for it.  When the depression hits and desperate Mexicans try to return home, we'll stop them at the border and force them to pick lettuce for fifteen cents an hour as part of their penalty for illegal entry.<br/><br/>Dan Kravitz  There is confusion because we have a confused and mentally ill president. When will the GOP ask this president to resign?Simple math.  1 year 20% surtax on Mexican imports.  Let them retaliate in kind. $60bn annual trade deficit with Mexico * 20% = $12bn net to the U.S. = wall paid for.  All of these liberals who hate Trump and said they would leave the U.S. if he was elected seem to love Mexico all of the sudden.  They are free to leave!  Why do liberals love drugs, gangs and crime from Mexico?  Why do they hate the families of children killed by illegal immigrants?So, if Mexican goods will no longer be competitive because of a 20% price increase to absorb the Trump tariff, then those Mexican goods won't sell in the US, Mexican imports will plummet to nothing under your economic theory, and -- 20% of zero being zero -- the tariff will not generate any money to pay for the wall. Brilliant.So you're saying that Mexico will just lower all their prices by 20 percent to offset the tax so we don't buy even more from the Chinese? I doubt it- they'll export as much as they can elsewhere and retaliate with tariffs of their own.  We do, actually sell them goods too.  This is a lose-lose scenario which is impressive, especially if you think of it as a zero sum game.Unlike most presidents of the past, Trump is keeping the pot stirred, so his opponents, like Mexico, don't know what's coming next. Keep them on their toes. Mexico has taken advantage of the USA for too long. Its time America stood up to Mexico. Put Mexico in its place. Thank you. They voted for this man but they also forgot that we are in it together. Don't understand how we got so mad at Obama then decided to appoint a person that don't have experience and humility to occupy such position. More like hiring a carpenter for a dentist job, yeah they both remove stuffs. While a dentist removes your teeth a carpenter also removes nails. HehehehehehAnd just wait until Mexico ends the importation of all of that cheap corn grown in the Midwestern states. The howling will be long and loud.And don't forget that Mexico could also impose a 20% tax on US imports to Mexico.  That street runs both way.  There you go Frank. Sooner or later the Republicans will have to choose. And this country hangs in the balance. He's ill, his narcissistic personality disorder is at the extreme end of the spectrum, and at 70, it's leaking out all over the place. This will only get worse. Each day must become 24hrs closer to impeachment. He's gotta go, let's not wait till it's him or us. Call or write your congressperson now.As for Mr. Trump's great wall: Ladders, ropes, drills, etc etc. And, of course, shovels: 10 feet down, 10 feet across and 10 feet up again. Mexico is not a prison, it is a large country with  tools -climbing or otherwise - available everywhere at wholesale prices. IMPULSIVE: acting or done without forethought.<br/>synonyms:	impetuous, hasty, emotional,<br/><br/>Trump is preparing to start a trade war over a wall that reasonable people do not believe in. A wall that will change nothing about illegal immigration. A wall that antagonizes our closest southern neighbor unnecessarily. Nobody has proven that illegal immigration is a drag on our economy ever. Immigration is how we grew to be such a powerhouse. Trump's and many others problem is the diversity created by the Hart-Cellar immigration Act of 1965 that allowed many non-white people to immigrate legally to the US. Indians and Chinese for example. Couple that with Hispanic illegal immigration and suddenly lily white America is no more. That is the problem here and, in Britain. Immigration is our power and growth combined at a time when population densities in Europe, Russia and Japan are falling. Immigration keeps us on top.There's good faith negotiation with the desire to maintain a positive long-term relationship, then there's extortion and not caring who you alienate. Clearly, Trump prefers the latter. That might work with a small contractor you want to screw out of what you owe them, but it's a losing strategy when it comes to international relations. It won't be long before Trump will make the US the pariah of the world.They are Mexicans thats why.<br/><br/>Racism begins by abandoning logic and facts and the looks for excuses to justify its hateful actions.If the Republicants truly believe that the ACA is unsustainable why not allow it to die of its own accord?  If that were to happen they could easily say "told you so" and go back to handling health care in the manner they've long preferred- letting the CEOs take care of the whole thing while the poor and the disabled check out books from the library entitled "How to Heal Your Own Disease."  BTW, if they're really as much opposed to mandates as the rest of us are to paying for visits by the resolutely uninsured to hospital emergency rooms, how's this for a compromise: anyone who visits a hospital and is either uninsured or otherwise unable to pay their bill for services rendered MUST immediately apply for insurance or be refused treatment.  Once having been approved for insurance the patient would thereupon be committed to remain in such a plan until such time as he/she shuffles off their mortal coil.  Fair enough?         It's a dance move: the hands are held palms out in front of the body, with the fingers extended. "The crux of the matter should never have been who would pay for it, but rather that it was an unfriendly act toward a friendly country . . . it will generate countless social, cultural and environmental problems along the border; raise the cost and danger of unauthorized crossings"<br/><br/>This writer opposes the Wall because he wants unauthorized crossing to continue. He opposes a Wall because it might work to raise the cost and danger of crossing.<br/><br/>I'm not sympathetic to the idea that Mexicans have some right to cross, and that it is unfriendly to stop them.I hope the emus will release my longer post (after a human realizes that any "bad" words in it are used properly), but while waiting I will say now that I was taken aback by Deb's use of the word "colloquialisms" for descriptors in the 2017 and 1967 clues for JOHN HENRY.Look at it this way. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Kathleen Sebelius spent fifteen months concocting then imposing ObamaCare on us, ultimately splitting the nation down the middle and destroying Democratic power at ALL levels of governance for what could be a generation; and beyond those hideous consequences, all that effort is about to be wasted with an ignominious repeal. Donald Trump may spend a couple of months obsessing over voter fraud and not consume a lot of resources doing it, then it’ll go away. As curious fantasies go, Trump’s are cheap and those of others unimaginably expensive to our political civility and ability to move forward productively.<br/><br/>Besides, what if he’s right? After all, everyone (including me, gulled as was everyone by an MSM that called it so entertainingly wrong) believed that President Hillary Clinton at this moment would be rehearsing her excuses for why Congress was calling every single one of her announced initiatives DOA.<br/><br/>Besides, Congress might exercise its power to more uniformly define voting rules for national elections, which usually determine rules for local elections as well, but a president has no power to do so apart from signing or vetoing such legislation. So, why all the hoopla over Trump? It’s not as if he’s established a track record as yet of arrogating power to himself that our federal courts rule with metronomic regularity he doesn’t possess – like some presidents we’ve known.<br/><br/>Tempest in a teapot.The Constitution gives the executive branch a tremendous amount of leeway regarding its powers.  This is done to allow the executive the power needed during extreme conditions.  When the world is falling apart, quick and decisive action must be taken.  But the framers never considered someone like Trump occupying the office of the executive branch.  They also never considered that the majority party would turn a blinds eye to the lunatic occupying the executive office just to push their fanatic ideology through.  Representatives were supposed to be only people of the highest integrity.    <br/><br/>Add the these two factors together, and we have the makings of a dictatorship.  Not a dictatorship won by military force. But a dictatorship put in power by a bamboozled public crying out for populism and facilitated by the majority party lusting after power in spite of the laws they claim to cherish.  (Wearing that little flag lapel pin justifies their actions).<br/><br/>To entrench their power, they undermine the electoral process.  Don't bother to vote, it's rigged.  If you want to vote for the other guy, we will make sure you can't. <br/><br/>Our nation has never been this close to the conditions that precipitated the rise of Nazi Germany.  We even have our ethnic scapegoats, Mexicans and Muslims.<br/><br/>The seeds of tyranny have been planted.  It's here.  The noxious weeds of totalitarianism are taking root.  Don't be like the German Jews who did not leave.  They thought it wouldn't get any worse.As I understand the review process posts with "bad words" never make it to a human.  I had that problem a few weeks ago with the "a" animal Jesus rode on.  Deb explain why that post never appeared even though the word actually appears in crosswords.   So you could wait a long time for your post.The article was insipid and spiced with the in articulations of a tribesman roasting a goat over dung coals. However, the architectural observations were cooked sous vide and left there.A worthy Saturday challenge. Couldn't get going until JOHN HENRY drove a stake in the ground for me and OPENed some DOORS. <br/><br/>BANG UP JOB Mr. Gulczynzski!"No one will have health care at all."  Come on!  There will always be doctors, medical centers, insurance and pharmaceutical companies ready to offer a helping hand at a healthy price. Please tell us how you personally are "suffering" as a consequence of other people finally having access to care that remains more affordable (for them) than it was before the Act was implemented.   “Education is dangerous - Every educated person is a future enemy”----- Hermann Goering quote<br/>This is not Trump's war on education, it is the GOP war on education. I suspect Trump never heard of her until some GOP legislator or Trump staff promoter her as a choice. She has no record of doing any thing to improve education, or help the less fortunate. She is another leech who can not have enough money, she needs more.<br/><br/>I suspect this holds true for all of Trump's choices, as far as we have seen, he did not have much to do with politicians until he decided to run for president, even then the party was not fond of him. We are seeing many references to Trump and his people as being compared to the politics of the Third Reich. We have been told by one of his daughters he was and avid reader of Hitler's writings, my term for him is Der Gropenfuhrer. <br/><br/>Charter schools are the antithesis of public schools, the backbone of our education system. They are elitist, serve special interests, teach alternative facts. The teachers are not free to teach controversial subjects such as the Theory of Evolution, there is no tenure, so the teachers are subject to the likes and dislikes of the administrators.<br/><br/>Charter schools are an example of alternative education and public asset privatization.  there are some good charter schools, but they cost more to attend than most lower income families can afford,  they take money from the public school system,  lowering the quality of those schools.You’d think the destruction of Britain’s Labour Party would be enough of an accomplishment in wrongheadedness for one man’s lifetime without seeking yet another. Uh … wait a minute. That was the OTHER white meat, wasn’t it?<br/><br/>It’s a dreadful blow to the aspirations of millions, but the truth is that we don’t feel an obligation to risk embedded jihadist terrorists just to satisfy ONE Brit’s sense of the rightness of open borders – or even of millions of Americans who flog the Kumbaya of open borders. In the end, much of America will support Trump’s decision because it will make us safer. The global refugee pandemic needs to be addressed by an international effort that seeks to re-stabilize failed and near-failed societies gouting refugees by the tens of millions, but that effort won’t be one that absorbs large numbers of them into stronger societies to destabilize THEM. People should re-boot shattered lives AT HOME, with help – and seek to do something about the cultures that caused the problems in the first place.<br/><br/>As to the religious aspects of Trump’s decisions, that’s unfortunate, but the West is not under attack by Swedish Lutherans. It’s perhaps about time we recognized that. <br/><br/>Last I noticed, Mr. Miliband’s own Britain narrowly rejected his generous sense of the politically correct by voting to “Leave”, largely on this and related issues.<br/><br/>Absorbing millions of refugees while not fixing the societal problems that MADE them refugees is not a viable, sustainable solution.Congressional Republicans are waking up to the reality that actually governing is much harder than simply criticizing and obstructing. They have never had any intention of providing a viable alternative to the ACA. Repeal has always been the objective, and any "replacement" they offer will be nothing but ineffective window dressing that will leave millions more without care or bankrupt. The only silver lining I can see is that this might be the tipping point that causes those people who have been voting for Republicans against their own interests to finally wake up and reject this immoral profits-over-people madness.Here's hoping President Trump will figure out that Single Payer healthcare is the best "bang for the buck".  He can bully Big Pharma on the issue of price negotiations, having already said prescription drug prices are way too high.  And with a stroke of a pen, he can eliminate the Health Insurance industry for a vast savings.  Such an action will have a big impact on the pocketbooks of millions of Americans now stuck with ridiculously high co-pays.  And the system already exists to bring this about:  It's called Medicare.If these Republicans are so worried about rushing the repeal and replacing of Obamacare with a disastrous policy that will kill people they could refuse to do it.  Refusing to legislate is something they could no doubt do with their eyes closed and hands tied behind their backs. They wouldn't give Obama anything when he was President. I believe McConnell each stated that fact in just so many words. Isn't Kharma great?I guess it would have been unthinkable for these Republicans to work with Democrats to iron out the kinks in Obamacare one year at a time. Instead, they focused on sabotaging health care for Americans and childishly voting more than 60 times for its repeal. Now that they are faced with the challenge of doing something constructive, they are chasing their tails. All their proposals, such as high-risk pools, have already been tried with very poor results. By "equal access," they mean that anybody can go to the emergency room and leave insured Americans holding the bag.  The Republicans do indeed want to pull the rug out from under the American people, but don't want to be taken to task for it. Their concern is how to best manage expectations, not how to actually help people who can't afford insurance or sick people. Their obligation as they see it is to lower taxes, and it doesn't take an MBA to figure out that funding medical costs for sick, relatively unproductive people isn't a winning strategy for improving the bottom line. Indeed the beauty of running gov't like a business in terms of healthcare is that once people become unproductive at work, they are let go, and have to fend for themselves when it comes to paying for healthcare. That is the American way.<br/>Republicans have been lying about their proposals which are simply ways to allow healthy people to spend less on insuring sicker people, but the insurance companies have not called them out on it, have not pointed out say, that the goal of allowing insurers to compete across state lines would basically induce them to come up with the same policies designed to cherry pick healthy people that the ACA got rid of. So now we are at this point where  some people are still under the illusion that a "more affordable" (for who?) solution exists, and insurers are afraid to speak up for fear of angering the President.<br/>The only question is if President Trump will succeed at spinning this disaster as a remarkable success.The choices from a list of approved candidates has to rankle the Bernie Sanders fans reading this. The party owned the media so the inconvenient man had no chance.<br/>The corrupted old media as appears here on a daily basis seems to hunger for the chance to be the Approver of Correct Candidates for all parties.The fundamental reason for the failure of "democratic parties" is because they are actively being sabotaged at every step of the way. HK is not like the rest of the PRC, though the PRC is doing all it can to (forcibly) assimilate HK into the PRC and make it another bland, soulless megacity. If your elections are nothing more than bad theatre, your rulers up north are vicious autocrats still adhering to 19th century dogma as a guiding principle for nations,  and your native language and heritage are being eroded by cultural subterfuge, independence seems an enticing option.The Civic Party is small and irrelevant, even by HK standards. That the Times chooses to highlight such a fringe opinion smacks of ulterior motives. <br/><br/>Perhaps international forces would do well in giving platforms to small, extremist parties in the US?<br/><br/>"...and one day they can ban anyone who calls for universal suffrage and democracy."<br/><br/>That would be nice, Mr. Wong.The image of the wall is an apt one: “Mexico’s forceful resistance” strikes me as largely a pyrrhic response to a set of circumstances Mexico can’t materially influence. They can exit NAFTA – we would be seriously inconvenienced but they would be economically and socially destabilized in the ensuing catastrophe to them. They could cooperate less with us on drug and other law enforcement matters, but that would simply empower the murderous cartels to FURTHER dominate their society. They could call Trump specifically and Americans generally icky; but that and about $10 can buy you a Victoriano Huerta Pez dispenser on Amazon.<br/><br/>If domestic opposition to Trump’s posture from our Mexican-American and illegal populations becomes vocal, then that’s not a matter that will further endear those millions of illegals to Trump and could imperil billions in remittances to Mexico on which millions there live.<br/><br/>Mr. Castañeda appears to understand this “asymmetry”, and offers advice on how to frame the inevitable negotiations to come very soon over NAFTA (and some of that advice is very good). But the wall is going up, WHOEVER pays for it in the end, because until Mexico effectively gets its arms around WHY such a large proportion of its population wants to live in another country despite serious risks to do so, and DOES something about those reasons, we can’t trust that anything BUT a wall will allow us to control our southern border.Even the conservative David Brooks sees this for what it is.<br/><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/the-politics-of-cowardice.html?ref=opinion" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/the-politics-of-cowardice.html?ref=opinion" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/the-politics-of-cowardice.htm...</a><br/><br/>I have listened to interviews with Trump supporters the past week, and one theme does stand out, fear of immigrants. On would think those Mexicans harvesting broccoli int he Salinas Valley were all set to attack the rest of us.<br/><br/>The rejection of Iraqis who aided the U.S. in the invasion and occupation of Iraq is particularly cowardly. Trump and his supporters are the purveyors of cowardice, that is from where they get their followers. <br/><br/>They need a wall to keep those criminals from that he and Rep King of Kansas are so quick to demean, We have a large population of those with ignorance and avarice. We saw the Berlin wall and what it was for, not only to keep the East Germans from defecting, but to keep the west from introducing them to freedom. <br/><br/>The U.S. very responsible for the creation of ISIS with the Bush dismissal of the Iraqi Sunnis, refusing to take some of the refugees created by this. It is an act of cowardice. How sad that the chief of our troops is a coward, I worry about my grandson who is in the artillery, there is a good chance he will be sent to Korea to bolster Trumps fragile ego, the ego of a narcissist.High risk pools are apparently designed to make health insurance more affordable for healthy people. The question remains, who foots the bill for the sick people? If the answer is, they do, then this is clearly not insurance. If they are subsidized, then who is doing the subsidizing? Republicans don't believe in "transferring wealth", which may be why the high risk pools that were established were chronically underfunded, and had waiting lists.<br/>Republicans want to ration care by ability to pay, and the fact that everybody supposedly concerned about healthcare in American hasn't admitted it is outrageous. Sadly, too many people engaged in the healthcare debate are more solicitous of offending their colleagues than calling them out on their lies. What it would jump start is inversions, with the American firms most exposed (think Apple, Walmart, etc.) becoming foreign companies. End of problem for them. This lets them off the hook for their american employees. (Might need to engineer some kind of sale, and maybe spin-off a US only sub that could export their work to the international partner. Please NYT, begin to call a spade a spade.  The Far Right has taken over the United States government.Because they can, doesn't mean they should. This will only create even greater animosity toward the United States, and ramp up the threat of terrorist attacks on our home soil. You are an anti American. And you do not deserve the citizenship you holdAnd the judge will get smacked down because the President has the authority to bar entrance to the United States in this manner.  It is not based on religion but country.  It follows up on countries that Obama himself barred from participating in the Visa Waiver Program due to security risks.  The order was issued yesterday afternoon.  Anyone who boarded a flight after the order was issued should be returned and should be the responsibility of whomever permitted their boarding in the first place.  Those who have special circumstances should petition the US Consulates in the country from which they are departing and those already here should have to plead their cases INDIVIDUALLY not as a group as each instance is different.Someone told them a Muslim is going to take thier job at 7-11.And I suppose men that risked their lives in Iraq acting as interpreters for American soldiers are a "threat to this Country".  Your logic astounds me with it's brilliance.How about the people living here for 7 years with a job, a house and car and a dog.  Why would you keep a TAXPAYER out of the country.Oddly, the hope of America and its traditions is now in the hands of the press (not too much of a surprise) and the lawyers (very much a surprise). It's time for both estates to bash this imbecile president into submission to the Constitution and the laws. Congress seems to have no spine thus far; let us hope the Supreme Court will be more faithful.WRONG-your alternative facts are plainly wrong. There are two statutes passed by Congress in 1952 and 1965 which were  clearly violated by the Trump executive orderPlease review photos/video from outside the courthouse.  There were easily a thousand people there.  Not dozens.These are people who had visas and/or green cards that were already issued to them by the United States - in short, people that should have never been denied admission to the country, especially once in the air.  If they were truly perceived as a threat to this country, the State Department would never have issued them a visa in the first place.You don't think the 3 year vetting process is a serious inquiry? Do you think you could survive that sort of inquiry? Sad that Trump won't be subject to similarly rigorous vetting.So, Trump says that "the travel ban is working nicely."  Could there be a more delusional statement?  People are protesting in several cities, some travelers who were not allowed to enter are people from the middle east who are assisting our military, families are being ripped apart, and all of this was done with no warning or even a press conference? No, Mr. Trump, this is not "working nicely" at all. It is deeply offensive to many Americans, alarming to the world at large, and apparently something the potential ramifications of which do not concern you at all. I am heartsick. A vivid reminder to all Americans about the equal power of the<br/>executive, legislative and judicial branches. Fantastic. Who should choose?  Not president Trump who has covered himself and by extension you and I with shame. Maybe the three party system needs an overhaul. One person should not be able to cause so much consternation for so many.<br/><br/>My relatives fought in the revolutionary war, I am sure they are rolling over in their graves. This is all so unfortunate.<br/><br/>The saddest part is not that Trump appears to be mentally ill, the saddest part is that 42% think that these actions of a mentally ill man are okay.The indisputable fact of the matter is that the boldness of this action by the President of the United States is what his supporters voted for. Think people are missing the point of these actions which is to show the world that the status quo in the US  government  is over. Disrupter in chief will be his legacy and for that he must achieve  change. The outcome of this change will be disputable but his intent will not.  A populist leader only answers to his base and to expect otherwise is the false hope that earned them their victory. America is once again in a transition moment and that realization is credited to the President's determination to be accountable to his base. Not politics as usual. Refreshing and bold. Disrupting.They defend Trump because he is them with megabucks.FINALLY!   Someone with some authority, and a concern about the throngs of illegals being allowed to sneak, scurry, and hide in our innocent country. while plotting their evil deeds, has DONE something!    Thank you President Trump!<br/><br/>This SHOULD stop the hordes who have been made to believe that we are WEAK and STUPID!   Some should think twice about being placed in limbo, and possibly being returned, rather than coming here for easy pickings.  It's the lawyers who recommended them to do so.Trump is a danger to our democracy. Bannon is his henchman. The Republican Party is a feckless group that quietly stands by as the Constitution is defrauded.<br/>Shame to any that supports this totalitarian regime.That is not what he is doing. Open your eyes.Rule of Law in America is the way it goes here. You can make up whatever you like but that is beside the point. Trump has to follow law not whim.Unfortunately much higher in America because taxpayer money seems to have been syphoned off the last 8 years for every non-America cause out there and then some.  Instead of keeping the Americans who have paid into the system healthy. Pakistan, Afghanistan are not part of the ban.Stop living in a fantasy world and realize there is real evil in the world. Everyone doesn't think believe what civilized people do, and will kill us to change us to their views.Cleaver point save the recognized fact that Marx is hard to find in western thought as is the other ‘wise man’ Lenin. Marx is also a little difficult to find in content in China today but Lenin is doing well in the structure of the CCP. Education Minister Chen Baosheng is the little man trying hard to please the boss, but having described Christmas, a forbidden western Holiday,  to four separate class rooms in three different cities, I think its safe to say the teachers may not be listening.You have the wrong adversary perhaps, the Left however defined has little input into what you are worrying about that sounds like ‘Globalization’. The driving force there in Neo-Liberalism and its champions are Corporate Interest and the politicians who conform to those interest – a very long way from old fashioned Liberalism. IBO schooling in China is probably doing the children some good in making integration into Western Universities more graceful. But would not go on to think that changes their perception of being Chinese, that is buried much deeper.A suggestion I came across years ago for puzzlers who find Mondays and Tuesdays less than challenging: use only the horizontal clues; no cheating. It's kind of fun.I remember my high school years in state college high in penn. The american students and chinese students quickly developed a poisonous relationship: the chinese students told me americans really hate china and is trying to dismantle their country by assisting dissidents and dalai lama. And yet the west still denies subverting china, how ironic.Bureaucracies generally need two pools of employees. One pool consists of analysts and designers who identify and clarify challenges, create response strategies and systems to address those, and relate behavior to performance. The second pool are the operators whose attention to day-to-day matters help to assure agencies function effectively yet have the stand-by capabilities to ramp up when needed. Most of the Center for Disease Control operations are routine although highly technical but it needs the capability to address unknown diseases during an epidemic. What keeps these capacities efficient are the middle managers constantly confronting the balance between the routine and the exceptional, the familiar and the new. Donald Trump has some familiarity with the operational needs of the real estate and entertainment industries but how well does he understand the relationship between direct service clinical personnel in the V.A. and the management of outreach services vs. records control? How will a hiring freeze affect departmental IT units compared to public information services? What Trump seems to want is a reduction in service effectiveness so there are fewer audits of high net worth individuals or inspectors to make sure fecal matter is not included in ground meat at your supermarket. As the husband of a federal employee in law enforcement I assume he wants my wife tracking the smuggling and finance operations of international drug cartels. But then again perhaps not. When something sounds really stupid, like exposing the whole body to temperatures of -200 degrees; it sounds really stupid, because it is. If the Democratic program is far left, then all other prosperous countries are far left and far-left is normal for prosperous countries.  Actually it is far-left only to modern Republicans who have become far right.  A conservative approach to the New Deal would be to gradually trim its excesses; getting rid of it quickly in large chunks is radical and based on a faith that market forces will quickly emerge to replace government planning and regulation.  <br/><br/>The reason for the rise in entitlements is that people are living longer because of sometimes-expensive medical care that did not exist in the past.  The market solution to this rise is exemplified in the drop in lifespan of whites who did not go to college.  UnFAMILIAR with LORAIN, and I've become so tethered to my IPhone that "Neighborhood buzz?" meaning a LOCAL CALL had me nonplussed for a moment. (This reminds me of a great joke involving a travel agent that I can't repeat here, but "travel agent" is another 2-letter phrase that is fading into obscurity - so if you show up while I'm tending bar I'll have to tell you that joke immediately!) Anyhow, it took me a couple of trips around the grid to fill this one. Probably 4, actually. So - extremely gettable but a satisfying exercise.This comment seems so out of touch with the expectations placed upon today's doctoral students. Forty years ago, faculty were still being hired with a well-placed phone call from their graduate advisors, and completion of the dissertation was the sole expectation. Today (in a field like literature) roughly one-quarter of recently minted Ph.D.s will actually land full-time, tenure track positons, and will have published half a dozen articles and maybe a book or two before being hired. The rest will either find work outside of academics, or barely sustain themselves in a life of piecing together adjunct teaching jobs. You're correct that many universities who never place their students in jobs do exploit them for their cheap labor. But the sad fact is that in most fields, less than a dozen programs produce 90% of the hires, and those programs are every bit as rigorous than leading programs forty years ago, with the added element of dramatically higher levels of competition. Sadly, a consequence of this hyper-competition is the felt need to give catchy titles to conference papers, but to imagine this is a sign of decreased rigor suggests you may be fairly removed from what goes on in higher education today.Mongolia is a landlocked country stuck between Russia and China, and<br/>was a part of China until WWII, under an accord between USSR and Nationalist government, a continuation of over 100 years of history of<br/>China losing territory as well as sovereignty to western powers starting<br/>with the Opium War, even though China was supported to be on the<br/>winning side of the war.  But the fact remains that there is more<br/>Mongolians actually live in China (in regions called inner Mongolia)<br/>than in Mongolia, and China has given substantial economic and social<br/>support to Mongolia over the last 30 years, especially after its<br/>economy took up. Mongolia is certainly free to seek help from other<br/>countries like India and US, but it can't escape its geological situation<br/>and time.  But Dalai Lamas was a puppet of China during the Qing,<br/>as both Tibet and Mongolia were part of China.Nice, challenging little Tuesday entry.<br/><br/>Being an Ohioan by birth, I naturally threw in TOLEDO at 42A. When, however,  it started looking like a source of trouble, I tossed it into the lake, and a few new crosses quickly showed me that the correct answer was LORAIN.<br/><br/>With a clue like "Soldiers' digs," who could blame me for immediately putting in FOXHOLES, but like TOLEDO, it just wouldn't work, and TRENCHES ended the problem.CoZ,<br/><br/>UCAL is an abbreviation for the University of California that appears often in crosswords, and almost never anywhere else.  "Cal," or "UC Berkeley," yes. "UCal," not so much.  Clemens should get into the Hall because of what he did with the Red Sox *before* he used steroids.

Wonderful, Mr. Adams. And lucky constituents.Huh, so you equate teaching historical facts (Columbus's role in the age of exploration) with teaching Communist Party propaganda? Well, don't worry - I'm sure you can find a school in the US that teaches commie propaganda as truth. This is what Commies do - They lie and then they brainwash and push propaganda to cover up the lies. Why is anyone surprised?

Good for<br/>them!What a nonsensical history posited by RL  . What froze our politics was unprecedented Republican obstruction that led to government shutdowns, mindless routine filibusters  and threats to default on payments for services already rendered basically that led to a credit downgrade from S&amp;P . Even as approval ratings for Congress sank to 9% thanks to this grinding exhibition, the Republicans have been rewarded by voters , at least the ones that support establishment Republicans. The right wing populism of the Tea Party has moved into the person of Donald Trump who will take office as a compromised man , low approval ratings, supported by a foreign power, and voted against by a numerical majority of Americans. A ludicrous figure who stoked the worst passions, temperamentally unfit and a needy narcissist. It's time for those opposed to this mess  to learn something from Republicans now. THAT is what this article is about    Nice evening to stay home and do the puzzle in bed. Eight inches of new snow and twenty-two degrees. We get an arctic freeze next-woohoo.

The remaining 90 percent must make their way in industry, an area where supervisor's lack of expertise is magnitudes higher. The potential for new hires to skate by with impressive sounding credentials, or for those seeking promotion or junkets based on easy-to-attend conferences is that much easier. This was under-reported in the article and magnified by so many professors saying "not at my school" with indignant tones.<br/><br/>Academic ivory towers benefit by skimming the creamiest of the crop, but they are also the most well-positioned authorities to become arbiters of which journals and conferences are legitimate.

The result that science is accused of being nothing more than another lobby, seeking its place at the trough--where there is no truth, just special interests--is not shocking.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that many of the tenured select say it's not a problem for real institutions or legitimate professors! It is this ostrich-in-the-sand attitude that lets our most respected representatives make the other 90% of doctoral students feel left in the breeze upon graduation with historically poor job prospects.No mandate when the GOP rammed through new voter restriction laws that gave them control of 70 percent of the electoral college votes. Gerrymandering being the most punitive to the people's will.It wasn't meant as a joke, since I was quoting a 2016 candidate.Can we also talk about putting Steve Bannon in a permanent seat on the National Security Council, while removing the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of National Intelligence. And spare me talk that his 7 years as an officer in the Navy is just as good as a 4 star general. <br/><br/>Will the Republican leadership find ANYTHING Trump does outrageous? Aren't they supposed to be the national security tough-guys? What is it Trump wants to do or is already doing he wants to keep hidden from the smart people?There are many kinds of bibingka but It is surprising to hear it described as an appetizer.  It is usually eaten as a treat or a dessert, often with fresh coconut gratings and brown sugar.  It is also topped with a runny caramel made of the coconut milk cooked with sugar, reduced to a soft ball stage and spread over fancy grade white rice cooked with coconut milk and water in a pot and flattened on a pan lined with banana leaves.  Recipes are mostly unwritten and handed down in the kitchen not taught in a school.  The best Filipino food is always very fresh and very varied.  The use of lime, 'calamansi', and tamarind are a good part of its flavor.  <br/><br/>Filipino cooking is inherently fusion, incorporating  Chinese and Spanish cooking, many of its ingredients imported.  Seven Up is a bit of a surprise - as a staple - sounds like Spam in Hawaii. <br/><br/>Writing this is making me hungry! When I had breast reduction surgery about eight years ago the surgeon told me quite specifically that withe this procedure, 25% of patients lose sensation, 25% have better sensation and 50% would experience no change. I guess I'm grateful that I had a [woman] surgeon who made a point of stating this clearly in advance.I wonder where this bit of misinformation originates. You hear it pretty frequently: taxes on corporations necessarily are ultimately paid by consumers.<br/><br/>Thing is, you won't learn this in any econ class; not even 101. One of the really basic "hey let's draw a graph of a market and calculate stuff" is tax incidence. And even at the most basic levels the case is crystal clear that consumers only carry the whole tax in rare circumstances. And that a lot of common setups in fact fall entirely or largely on shareholders.<br/><br/>And yet here we are; jp here clearly lacks any econ training whatsoever, but is just so certain he or she knows more about who will pay this tax than a Nobel economist. I suppose that's pretty much the sentiment that caused us to elect to the most powerful job in the world a man with no government experience, no knowledge of any area of policy, no interest in learning anything at all, and perhaps most important no respect for democracy, laws, norms or even decency.Thanks for this thoughtful comment. Aside from the practical problem of accommodating the millions in need from the disastrous world situations in progress, which Germany tried to acknowledge and humanely respond to with mixed results, the more fortunate are unlikely to put their fortunes at risk beyond a variable threshold compounded of compassion and means and emotion. But the US threshold has been stingy, and that's an understatement. We are forgetting how to share.It will be interesting to see if the chaos this unleashes makes the markets insecure tomorrow. That bubble at the casino on Wall Street is going to burst sooner or later, but a lot of the profiteers have already taken their money and run. Our looters and criminals are high end in this country, why worry about the poor and huddled masses of Ms. Liberty.Nope.   The Donald is a kakistocract.Want to complain?  Or win?<br/><br/>Swing voters choose primarily on economic issues.  On every other major issue, each voter - and each party - already has fixed positions, which they simply won't change.<br/><br/>80% of voters favor protecting Social Security.  70% or more favor a higher minimum wage.  So, why won't Democratic candidates *own* those positions, and win decisively? Because Democratic primary voters now hold traditionally Republican economic policy positions.  They are elitist snobs who pretend to care about the working class, but really don't.  They demonize anyone running on populist economics as a demagogue, and declare the broad prosperity of the New Deal as unrealistic and unattainable. They demonize any national leader espousing "nationalism" - as if it isn't their *job* to work for the good of the nation.<br/><br/>Trump is a symptom of a divided and disillusioned electorate that realizes any candidate approved by our establishment pols and media, by definition is not on their side.  The establishment news media has made themselves irrelevant - a joke - like we used to view communist propaganda newspapers, such as Pravda. This leaves voters desperate enough to vote for a Trump, and totally unreachable.  Calling them names is just going to make them stick their fingers deeper into their ears.With his misguided policy move to ban Muslim entry into the US not only Trump has exposed the US to new security threats but also invited worldwide disapproval and protests which might lead to serious legal challenges to his ill-conceived and mischievous immigration policy and a retaliatory ban on the visits of Americans to the Muslim countries. Even he himself might face a similar situation whenever he plans official visit to these countries. My husband noticed the same difference (in the pervasive stench of urine) between his mother's 1990s nursing home and his dad's 2000s nursing home. Nursing aides confided what has made most of the difference: adult diapers. This has certainly reduced the odor problem and the tedious work of changing wet/soiled bedding, but if diapers go unchanged, it's still a health problem for the resident.My sister once looked into taking our father in (for hospice care) and hiring home health aides. She made some inquiries -- in the major metropolitan area of Seattle -- and was essentially told "Good luck finding anyone." And at the going rate (which they earn!), anyone you'd find would be prohibitively expensive for 24-hour care, meaning family members would provide unpaid care for much of the 24 hours.One challenge with providing in-home care is having an elder-appropriate home. Fall prevention is critical. Even a ranch home may have a step up or down to navigate around an entry, and many bathrooms have been long designed to minimize space, rather than the room needed to provide assistance or structural supports such as grab bars. More effort is needed to make universal design features such as larger doorways, easy to grab knobs standard features.Why is this article illustrated with a cartoonish depiction of an elderly lady, tiny useless hands, helpless-looking, feet unable to touch the floor, looking upward for salvation?  Be careful: the ways in which you caricature the elderly have an effect on society and institutions, and give signals.  This cartoon seems to sanction the dismissal of older human beings. Ebmem, gh made it clear in his comment that some people are not well cared for at home.  Depending on the family resources and the level of disability, it is sometimes very difficult to care for some one with high needs properly at home.As a former RN supervisor:  you are wrong.  The care is horrible and when you report a problem to the Director of Nursing you become the problem yourself.  There are many unexplained deaths that the facility lies about and the family is helpless due to arbitration clauses in agreements signed upon entry.Assigning a letter grade reduces the analysis to a meaningless data point.  Within a single facility, one patient may have excellent care and one may have dismal care.  Determinants include the systemic functions of the facility, but also the individual dispositions of a particular resident, the particular staff assigned to that resident, and the attending physician.  Also the resources and medication therapy may be influenced by the insurance carrier for that individual resident.  The relationship of the family members and the staff can highly influence the care received, ranging from mutual respect to constant conflict.<br/><br/>Finally, much of the regulatory framework is not necessarily helpful, and often regulators value paper compliance above actual care delivered, and their intervention may actually divert good caregivers from delivery of care to completion of forms.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the complexity of care given to the frail resident matches the complexity of varied styles of living.  Trying to force the entire care structure into the medical care system, increases cost, increases liability concerns, decreases individual choices, and ultimately separates the resident from their natural social contacts.  The formality of this high tech care is often used as a salve for the guilty consciences of the family.Hindu, here.<br/><br/>This article is WRONG.<br/><br/>I moved to a Christian country. I repeat, I moved to a Christian country. It isn't my place to start whining that my Hindu culture isn't being accommodated. I left India, remember?<br/><br/>In India, a prominent politician tried to ban non-Indian (i.e., White) women from starring in Bollywood movies. That's India for you. It isn't the shining example of acceptance people make it out to be.Mr. Blow, much, much worse than the Trump-Bannon pickaxe that is digging up America's front lawn is the silence in Congress. The same Congress that threw up roadblocks every day of Barack Obama's presidency. <br/><br/>House Speaker Paul Ryan defended his president's "executive overreach" in direct contradiction to what he said in December 2015 on then-candidate Donald Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States: "This is not conservatism." Why the quick switch, Mr. Speaker? <br/><br/>Mitch McConnell, who opposed every day of Barack Obama's presidency, suddenly found a voice on ABC News: "Look, the president has a lot of latitude to try to secure the country." He wasn't as generous with his "latitude" between 2009-2017; one wonders why.<br/><br/>The new president, as this space has complained since the inauguration, is merely the rubber-stamp for Stephen Bannon. This attempted exclusion of refugees from nations with majority-Muslim origins is no accident. Nor is the Trump hard line about his Mexican wall or his threats to turn the streets of Chicago into, yes, "a war zone", by flooding the city with an armed National Guard. Would he, like Richard Daley in 1968, order them to "shoot to kill?" <br/><br/>What this president desires is anarchy and chaos and having achieved disorder, the next step is martial law. Citizen appeals to the SCOTUS for relief? With John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas wearing the black robes of refined and genteel terror?<br/><br/>I hear something ticking.Nothing in his DNA and lengthy record as a boarder line criminal and delusional megalomaniac business tycoon provides a glimmer of hope that an international disaster is not in our nation's immediate future.   Our only hope resides with what remains of the handful of sane  Republican establishment types, who must now be all but certain  that they will have to take courageous  action against their president. A rising tide of large, frequent demonstrations and great fear among the those few Republicans  who retain some semblance of moral leadership are our only glimmer of light against the gathering storm clouds and menacing darkness.Mr. Trump's biggest mistake is signing executive orders over the weekend which allows for demonstrations, spontaneous or otherwise.<br/>He should be advised by whatever staff he has in place that he should rein in his workaholic nature, narcissistic or not, and enjoy  his weekends, or at least wait until the workweek begins to sign orders. Play golf Mr. Trump or play with the grandchildren over the weekend.<br/>The American people have to go back to work on Monday and most will be at the job and be too busy to "fight for American values" when they are at work, except of course for the American value of working.  The most important thing for Trump supporters to understand is: you're next.<br/><br/>As soon as Trump finishes toying with the majority, he will turn on his supporters. This is what malignant narcissists do - idealize, devalue and discard.<br/><br/>The only way to stop it is to start impeachment proceedings. Calmly and firmly.<br/><br/>This is a bi-partisan task.Absolutely protest and demand justice! But, don't get distracted. Demand that Congress subpoena the tax returns so his indebtedness to Putin is exposed and he is impeached. Everything else he's doing, no matter how vile, is a calculated move designed to keep the focus away from this most basic flaw... that we have a puppet of a hostile foreign government sitting in our highest office. He must be removed!The president is playing to his red, racist and rabid base by fulfilling his campaign promises to make America great again. Everything he's done since being sworn in has produced outrage and incredulity. He's thumbed his nose at convention and with his Muslim ban has now violated the Constitution by targeting a specific religion, Islam, and its worshipers, as unwelcome and undesirable in the United States.<br/><br/>Speaker Paul Ryan, he of the day-long smirk during the Inauguration ceremonies, watched America change its colors and turn its back on everything the republic stood for since 1620. The Republicans pilloried President Obama for executive overreach and deemed his actions unconstitutional but have been silent on the excesses of this president. The GOP most certainly has this president's back.<br/><br/>Mr. Blow, you say that America will not stand for authoritarian abuse of power by a president and you are right, but but this is exactly what the country voted for in November. The angry red tide that washed this great white shark into the Oval Office may be happy now but soon they'll realize that we as a country are going to need a bigger boat.Thank you, Mr. Blow, for voicing our concerns so succinctly.  I wish more writers at the Times had your backbone. Sorry, to me the reversal, while encouraging, did nothing to undo the damage that was done in the public mind.  What the House Republicans have stated here is that corruption rules the day unless public outrage trumps the corruption.  What this reversal illustrates  is the need to continue to be vigilant and let public outrage be known at every turn when the Republicans and Trump attempt to fortify their oligarchy.  We should remember, so far, we still have a democracy in which the people's opinion can make a difference.  It is up to the public to protect that right.me too!!You say "It's hard for the adults to concentrate on running the country."<br/>Please-adults-and presidents- don't TWEET!Look down the list of comments, where are they from? California, Washington (Seattle) New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts - my advice to my fellow democrats would be to get in your car and drive to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan- there is another America out there that you are clueless aboutHe's going to have to do a lot of mucking out to do that.I watched my mother die of cancer.  She received palliative chemo for years, the last one about a few weeks prior to her passing. She could not say no to hope, but it was absurd at that point for anyone to sell it to her as hope.  It just killed her.<br/><br/>The regular conversation my mom had with her doctors was about using chemo to extend her life.  For awhile it did that.  Eventually it just seemed to be a way for her to witness her own body dying very,very slowly and painfully.  <br/><br/>The only part of the process that felt right to me was keeping vigil at her bedside.  My family committed to never leaving her alone in those last weeks.  We took shifts round the clock.  My mom died with the comfort of connection to those who loved her and the dignity of being someone who mattered. <br/><br/>If you love someone who is dying, you must get up the learning curve fast on how to be a genuine caregiver, how to be present, how to honor your loved one and how to  step in if the medical process seems to be overtaking your sacred space. Nothing is more precious.They haven't started out great here, have they? Truth be told.Ethical and Republican?<br/>Dishonor and Disrepute?Nobody is whining. They expect better from leaders. This hasn't started off well at all.Porch Dad, <br/><br/>With all due respect, the fact the you just used so many labels leads me to believe you've been brainwashed into thinking that labeling a person substitutes for the more difficult task of dialogue. <br/><br/>I disagree with you about those labels.  I also think that, sometimes, the medicine we need doesn't always taste good.  Mr. Trump may be exactly what America needs at this point in history. <br/><br/>America was imploding long before Mr. Trump ran for presidential office.Except Trump doesn't object to gutting the Ethics Committee. Just doesn't agree that it should be "first thing" on the agenda.Yes, please stop tweeting every thought that pops into your head with no filter or censorship.Exactly what I came here to say, tax returns included.This was a nice, smooth, but A TAD challenging Wednesday. I still can't quite grasp "M M M." Are these to be taken as three iterations of the Greek letter MU? If so, it's a pretty awkward entry. Same thing with BRUSH PILES. I'm pretty sure the phrase would have made no sense to most of us if not for the late, unlamented administration of George W. Bush, who was uniformly described as "clearing brush" during his frequent retreats to his Texas ranch. Quotation marks are employed for a variety of purposes.

Trump led to the reversal. <br/><br/>Nice writing and summation of nothing more than poor strategy, tactics and timing. The Ethics Office does not have to be dismantled. It only has to be played correctly and in this case rightly. <br/><br/>Let's report the truth. The Republicans now feel the burn and with that feeling out will come the matches to be applied to the Constitution, Bill of Rights, common sense and simple dignity. All decency, democracy and freedom will go out the window into the swamp of their own making.<br/><br/>The Republicans did not reverse themselves. They decided to delay what will be inevitable under Trump: wholesale looting of the government and public purse, destruction of civil and human rights and a new morality which says that owning and controlling 99% of the wealth and income is not enough.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, Too much of a good thing is not enough.<br/>I rarely met rich people who think they have enough. <br/><br/>The Ethics Office is a cover to be used only when one of its own is out of step with the rest. That is not ethics. It is immorality with a new conservative Christian facade. In his university scam, the enrolling losers are given an ugly LOL lesson in how to get yourself signed up for empty promises and shine and an AG is who you bribe to keep her from investigating.<br/><br/>As to paying your workers and contractors, stiffing is the course to go.<br/><br/>As for your own "charity", not paying into it yourself but taking out that what others pay in for your own bizz expenses is Trump's idea of being ethical.<br/><br/>Making up scary scenes in inner cities or New Jersey is his ethical standard for cheap political gain, in defiance of meticulously researched stats or actual witnesses.<br/><br/>Birtherism. A Clinton thing.<br/><br/>If gazillion profits for befriended polluters are affected, Trump's ethics prompt him to deny the one science field relevant to their profit flow Big Oil and its offshoots forgot to infiltrate and rig or prevent from being carried out at all.<br/><br/>Introducing yourself to a woman kissing and groping all over her the Don deems ethical for a celebrity, since the young things are so intimidated by the eventual setbacks for them if they resist, they give the 35 year old halfgod a free pass.<br/><br/>Dealing with political opponents by having your crowds rant "Lock her up!" and asking foreign states to hack her communication is ethically impeccable as justice standard.<br/><br/>Concerning Congressional ethics a show is put up for the public while handily discrediting the oversight without substantiating an iota.<br/><br/>Be tax "smart", profile on races and religions and no ethical end. None.I want all of their financial reports out every year. I'm just tired of this.I'm afraid Trump isn't capable of a reasoned rebuttal. He is an unfortunate reflection of much of the electorate.In other words, business as usual?<br/>Actually, I don't think it's a bad sign about Trump, only about Congress. The Republicans there don't seem to understand that Trump didn't get elected to allow more of the same old, same old, and I think there will be some tussles before they have it straight who's in charge. It should be interesting to watch.Right on the nail!Pass the pipe or whatever you are smoking.<br/><br/>Our lawmakers are not above the law: they are below it.68 ethics cases in seven years is an appalling high number. Someone needs to train our lawmakers more effectivelyIt seems that any party with too much power will in the end kill themselves. You're right, Iona. Where are his tax returns? Trump had nowhere else to go for money because he's so over-leveraged. So what does he do? He turns to the American people for his next scheme. He may have hit a goldmine this time because of a supine American people who were dazzled by fool's gold. In the meantime, he can't sleep because when he closes his eyes late at night, he sees his house of cards empire collapsing in his mind.<br/><br/>I bet it's hard work being The Donald, having to obfuscate 24/7.You opinion is perfectly ok but my experience has been different.  I have had 5-6 female bosses, and 4-5 male bosses.  <br/><br/>Overall women communicate better, are more considerate, and tend to play fewer games.  I sort of agree that women are more about teamwork and less about cynical team sabotage.<br/><br/>Men are often a little more ambitious -- for themselves.  Given the choice, I prefer working for women.  But honestly, despite the problems I have seen both genders behave mostly very effectively together.  Making it a gender war is unhelpful - and making it a sexual dynamic is also unhelpful.  Work is work.  Colleges have no choice under current law but to investigate students' allegations of sexual abuse. This does not constitute"usurpation" of criminal investigation, which can proceed independently. I am a college professor and former dean in the University of California. I can confidentially assert that no other serious disciplinary cases on campus are resolved on a mere preponderance of evidence basis. For example, if I knew that one of two students stole the answers to an exam and distributed them to classmates, and I was 51% sure that Student A stole the exam and 49% sure it was Student B, there is no way that Student A would be expelled or punished. We simply would not consider that strong enough evidence to take action.<br/><br/>While preventing and punishing sexual assault should be a very high priority for campuses, to make serious disciplinary decisions of any kind based on a narrow preponderance of evidence is not wise. It means that in potentially up to half the cases, you will be unjustly punishing a student. And in the cases of sexual assault, an unjust expulsion would likely be accompanied by an unjust social media campaign against the student, with potentially disastrous life consequences.Good to know that a large enough number of people read the NYT enough to be passionate, organized and focused to call their Congressional representatives and be successful at evoking shame in the ranks of those who would gut a process of ethics watchdogging that is producing results.  At last!Trump cleaves "us" from "them". That is enough for many.It's all a stage presence, a "persona" - while you're snickering about his grammar, he is becoming your master.<br/><br/>This act has been highly effective for him - if that's not smart, I don't know what is - certainly, not what Mrs. C. was doing during the campaign.<br/><br/>Even one term will do massive damage. If you don't want to live with him for a second term, you better go out and start organizing now - and don't worry about the grammar of the people you speak to.Getting sicker after a period of access to healthcare might just be what it takes to get working-class conservatives to actually vote their interest.Speaker Ryan appears to feel the same way. He'll "revisit" the "issue" at a later date, perhaps while our backs are turned and the spotlights are off.<br/><br/>It's not the principle, it's the "optics," as the asinine term today has it. President Obama took us from nearly 10 percent unemployment to well below 5 percent. No jobs created? Do you consider that "fake news"? <br/><br/>In contrast, DT has routinely destroyed jobs and small contractors by stiffing ordinary workers and small businesses. He couldn't even run a casino at a profit. I'm not sure we need more of that "experience." These Republican "lawmakers" are idiots.  For decades they've had no plans for health care, no thought to helping with educational opportunity, they've dumbed down the education system, created a landscape with a gun on every street corner waiting to kill an innocent victim, and they have relied on a failed trickle-down economic ideology that has produced the largest wealth inequality in world history.<br/><br/>So what's the first thing they do?...they try to pass measures in secret that would allow them to potentially carry out unethical, and even criminal, acts to benefit themselves.<br/><br/>The GOP has forgotten how to govern and, even worse, has lost the desire to do so.  Politics has become nothing more than a 3D version of poker in which they gamble the future of our nation away and give the remains to a foreign power..."move on"...one car wreck after another, but they tell us there's nothing to see.In my opinion, Title IX is important and does not contradict the justice system at all. When you think of a college institution as a kind of company or industry (you pay money, tuition; they offer a service, education), then it makes sense. Every employee handbook that I've read has a section asserting that disrespect, harassment or discrimination in the workplace can lead to termination and/or severe consequences. The same goes for colleges and universities. Harassment and discrimination (which makes up the foundation of Title IX) should lead to some form of review process to see whether or not the respondent ("accused," if you will) deserves to stay in that particular institution.<br/> Subsequently, if the reporting party chooses to press criminal charges before, during or after the review process at the university, then they can do that as well. Sexual assault can result in trauma, fear and even feelings of humiliation and isolation that make it difficult to process the incident. Thus, they might avoid calling local police.<br/>For this reason, I don't see the university system as a replacement of the justice system at all. I see it as a process, one that is adopted by most American institutions anyways, to review the incident and make a decision based on the evidence provided. Essentially, it serves to determine whether or not an individual violated the "company rules" and what sanctions should be given out, whether that means remedial therapy, suspension or expulsion. Republicans in Congress are worried about ethical oversight - not a good sign for the future. Here's a novel idea, Congress: Don't do bad stuff, then you won't have to worry about oversight.Enough. Can we please face facts? Trump is crazy. Literally. His personality disorder is, at best, semi-amusing when associated with a whack job we may encounter at work or in the neighborhood. But this man is about to become president. He sits in his 5th Avenue aerie surrounded by sycophants and tweeting nonsense, completely detached from reality and putting the security of the nation at risk. You, NYT, and the rest of the media are facing the biggest challenge in American history. Please, please take this man down.This was a bizarre read and should not have been published.Trump's tweets are nauseating, like practically all his public utterances. We might have to endure much worse - his speeches, let alone his policies. This being said, Chinese and Russian diplomacy is nothing to brag about. It often expresses itself in even shorter form: their vetoes at the UN Security Council which are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, from Darfour, to the Balkans, to Syria. We can only hope that Trump's tweets don't unleash a similar legacy.   Love your last paragraph!<br/><br/>Witty!@ saizwho<br/>Republicans have led a very effective campaign against Obamacare, aided and abetted by Fox and right wing radio.  There are polls that give the ACA high marks when it is called the ACA rather than Obamacare and some of the components of the law are very popular such as the coverage for children until they are 26 and prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.<br/>It is anybody's guess what they will replace it with, for 7 years they have been trying to repeal it with no alternative plan, like Chuck Schumer said, "the dog has caught the bus".<br/>I am an ER physician and I think the ACA has helped many that would have used the ER to obtain their primary care, a bad idea but was very common before the ACA, less so now.  ER's are expensive and there is no continuity of care so to speak.<br/>I understand your worries and I feel for you but you can take heart in the fact that your benefits may extend for 2 years, they won't do anything to upset you before the midterm election.<br/>If you want an explanation of Republican logic, read Dickens.Should we care what the Chinese communists advise us about running a democracy? More fake news--exaggerated importance and siding with our competitors. Reporters are afraid that they're being cut out of Trump''s relationshipeith the people.China is right about the tweeting.  Trumps' tweets are demeaning, rude, sarcastic, rambling, ambiguous. We may understand the nuance of his tweets but will other nations? Remember the misunderstandings and threat of nuclear war with Russia when John F Kennedy was in office. Russia had missles in Cuba aimed at us.  This is serious President Elect Trump. Get off your golden seat and do some real work, starting with proper grammar and full sentences. I can't believe I'm asking the next President of the United States to use proper English when it comes to diplomacy between nations. Trump went to Wharton undergrad which is harder to get into than Harvard.  Regardless, predicting draconian outcomes while comparing irrelevant pedigree to assert nonsensical points seem to be what the NYT favors these days.I am mystified that there are no national security rules or guidelines that actually forbid federal officials, including the president, from using social media e.g tweets to engage foreign powers on matters of national import. What I had always held to be strict rules of behavior and engagement at the presidential level have turned out to be only conventions followed by the serious and well-informed but completely disregarded by Trump. Some serious rethinking of the rules and how to force adherence is in order or we are in big trouble.The latest news, courtesy of the Wall Street Journal, is that Emperor Donald wants to reform and cut back the intelligence agencies.<br/><br/>This is classic dictator practice:<br/><br/>Gain power.<br/><br/>Limit the press.<br/><br/>Limit the intelligence services.<br/><br/>Compromise national security.<br/><br/>Emperor Donald sounds like a DICTATOR in the making.  <br/><br/>Even Evan McMullen, who ran as a third party Presidential candidate, and is a former CIA operative, thinks the same thing.<br/><br/>The time for true American patriots, of whatever political persuasion, to stand up to this buffoon would-be dictator is NOW.<br/><br/>We live in interesting times.Will world leaders one at a time or in droves start to laugh out loud at the tweeter n chief.<br/>"Don't Tweet Me Bad"<br/><br/> - Xi JinpingCome on China, you should be smart enough to manipulate this er bai wu!! It's an easy three step process...<br/><br/>1) Have Mr. Xi exclaim how brilliant Trump is. Make sure to post it prominently and off.<br/><br/>2) Apologize to the American people (you don't have to mean it) for causing such hardship by taking jobs from the USA.<br/><br/>3) Let it be known far and wide that you want to make amends to the American people by purchasing some American companies and hiring more US workers. For every worker you actually hire claim three and give all credit to Trump. <br/><br/>This simple effort will have Trump eating out of China's hands. Try it!!First of all, Donald Trump doesn't have any intelligence. Second of all, Donald Trump doesn't have any intelligence. His schtick is running afoul and he hasn't even taken office yet. I am starting to think he himself is a person who must be watched.The intelligence agencies do need an overhaul and a reduction in number. I worked with several of them for a number of years and encountered endless petty bureaucratic infighting and stove-piping. There are some very good people working in these agencies but they are outnumbered by an army of mediocre people working hard to justify their existence.Trump is so obviously Putin's Manchurian Candidate. How can America let this traitor be sworn in as President?Now I think I understand what insanity is.For a narcissist as sick as Trump, admitting being wrong makes him a loser;<br/>not having the last word makes him a loser;<br/>not being the best at everything makes him a loser;<br/>and allowing the perception that his tremendous brain is anything less than the best makes him a loser.<br/><br/>Don the Con is always winning because he is never a loser. For him, self-perception is self-deception. He is so great at lying because he actually believes his own lies. Sick!DT casts intelligence aside in more ways than one!  Seriously - this is scary, surreal.  I cannot remember a person who shows more fealty to a foreign dictator than to the US and more respect for a hacker than the American intelligence establishment en route to the White House - <br/><br/>Honestly people.  Why are we marching oh so properly and politely off a cliff?Somehow Biden's sometimes unscripted, honest remarks were always 'big gaffes' in the news media and he was painted as something of an idiot when most of his 'gaffes' were accurate observations, just not filtered in the way that is expected of a politician. But the media succeeded in making Biden look unserious to most of the public.<br/><br/>Enter Trump, who speaks in the same unfiltered way, just way less smart and wise, but got away with it.<br/><br/>Why? Because Biden's constituency, including most journalists, are obsessed with political correctness, while Trump's people are not. Sensible liberals are punished for talking sense by the powerful factions in their midst that dictate how a person is allowed to talk. Problem is, most regular people do not agree with their p.c. ideology.Good for Donald Trump.  I worked 16 years for a DoD intelligence agency.  They aren't infallible and they make many mistakes the average person does not hear about, because all of the employees are restricted from talking to even their families about what happens at work.  It suits the government to encourage a mythical reputation of the intelligence agencies being all knowing, all powerful invisible forces.  Just because they say some thing is not an automatic indication that they are correct.  Questioning their authority is like questioning the authority of the church, Blasphemy!<br/>The NYT should be just as skeptical about any of their claims.Or maybe it's as simple as the fact that the concepts "Donald Trump" and "Intelligence" exist in separate, non-interacting universes.A real man would demand another election...this one without russian interference.<br/><br/>Only then can he really be called a US President.<br/>Short of that there will always be an asterik next to trump's name in the history books.<br/><br/>2 actually.<br/><br/>One for needing russia's help tricking low information voters with fake news and the other for losing The American People's Vote by a staggering 3 million votes.<br/><br/>A real man would demand another election...this one without russian interference.If he continues to refuse to release his tax returns, he should be subpoenaed and forced to do so. Anything less, and it is impossible to know<br/>how deeply involved he is with the Russian kleptocracy. If, after taking office, anything in his taxes indicates he has violated the emoluments clause, it should be considered as potential grounds for impeachment.I feel sorry for the thousands of hardworking intelligence community employees in the U.S. and abroad - many of whom put their lives on the line on a daily basis - because for the next four years, no matter what the issue, even their most prudent and hard-won analytic insights are bound to be ignored and disparaged by the top "customer" as long as they don't jibe with his ill-informed, self-obsessed worldview. Someone in Trump's inner circle had better find a way to break through soon, or his sour grapes and self-delusion are going to have deadly consequences.I am afraid.   "Donald Trump Casts Intelligence Aside"........Classic!Mr. Trump's foot soldiers (the transition team) are doing the same thing all over the District.<br/><br/>They have been receiving briefings at every agency, with honest assessments of agency programs, supported by data with sources cited.  They then come back to the agencies wanting to know the names of directors and program officers working on things Mr. Trump denied, refuted, or misrepresented when it stoked rallies of potential voters.<br/><br/>Management by disparagement is the new norm.<br/><br/>It is one thing to do that at, say, EPA, Ed, or Labor, but quite another to do that to the thousands of Americans who risk themselves daily in the clandestine services.  <br/><br/>Will he treat intelligence officers and their leadership, indeed all federal officers, like the building contractors whose finished work simply was beyond his gormless whim?The last paragraph of the article is a moot point because those voters who did not support Trump know to take our intelligence agencies' advice more seriously than he does. And those who voted for Trump seem to be eagerly eating up everything he says and cheering him on no matter what he says.  It is an echo chamber. And remember Trump's ridiculous reversal on the birther issue - he will reverse his opinion on anything just as easily and shamelessly. Trump is either brain-damaged or owned by Russia.  The Congress should move to make sure he does not take office.  If the Congress does not act, many of them will be seeking employment in 2018.What a terrifying question, indeed.  The implications are truly horrific - unbelievable.I completely agree Joe is the bomb.<br/>But always remember, after 30 years of partisan attacks by the petty gop Secretary Clinton has never been so much as charged with a crime...much less convicted of one.The similarities between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un become more striking (and frightening) every day. From the most concerning (their most sinister obsession with their own self-concern) on down to the more amusing (their fascination with their own hair).Trump is a sociopath. He is afraid of nothing. He sees the country as an enterprise. He sees it as something he can potentially own as an asset to leverage and/or sell off. It is his only perspective on existence. He sees Putin as someone he can do deals with. Sees him like any sucker he sold a brassy condo to. And Putin is megalomaniacal enough to want to take possession. Putin sees him playing Trump to take a geographical prize. So it's reciprocal. All those other problems you bring up - debt, etc., disappear when you are a despot. So it's a win-win-win except we lose HUGE. And Ivanka gets installed into the global elite. And, if the deplorables are played correctly, Josh comes out unscathed to stay by her side. And if he overplays the deplorables and Josh is collateral damage? No big deal. Ivanka will make other deals and convert to whatever religion she needs to. She knows the drill. Daddy made sure she understands exploitation. <br/><br/>Clown Trump is old. He's over 70 and obese. He needs a "crowning achievement" to validate his lifelong resume of exploitation, bankruptcy and scam. The fact that that will come with lots more exploitation and strife is of no tangible concern to him. The ends justify the means.I'm beginning to wonder if Trump has not yet figured out that the election is over, that he won and that he now has to be president.<br/><br/>No, he still sees government as something to be fought, to be denied, to be opposed and diminished. He thinks government agencies are ALL out to get him,   need to be opposed, need to be brought to heel.<br/><br/>Good grief. Someone in high places at the NYT or Washington (before the inauguration) needs to review the personality disorder known as Borderline problems and Narcissisitc Personality. Almost everything that has and is happening with Trump can be related to one of these personality styles. He cannot tolerate anything that would possibly undermine his election or the statements that he has make regarding his impressive knowledge of everything. ie. 'I know more than the generals' -'I don't need security information - I have a mandate with the most impressive votes of any president; we will give you a health care plan that is better than anything you have ever had; nasty nick names and denigrating statements of gov't officials and other candidates etc. etc. He's months (weeks?) away from saying "Let them eat cake"Putin is not some Soviet strongman.  Wake up and learn current, and past events.If intelligence officials knew about this hacking in late 2015, it is a shame that the White House wasn't informed sooner and the Russian government not informed that there would be serious consequences if the activity did not cease-- with follow-up action to deter the Russians if need be.<br/><br/>Another query: are campaign organizations and U.S. political parties also backing social media disinformation campaigns to influence elections?  I would be surprised if some of this has not been occurring.What can we expect from someone who has a record of swindling small contractors, a record of fraud and using plagiarized texts in his fake university, a record of using his charity for his own benefit, and a record of cheating investors in his ventures?<br/><br/>Today's WSJ head line, "Trump Creditors Are Many, Varied. "Trump business debt are held by more than 150 institutions. Hundreds of millions of debt attached to Trumps properties some backed by his personal grantee have been securitized, which has been used for more than $1 billion of debt connected to his properties.<br/><br/>Any default would put his whole enterprise into conflict with the lender, on of whom is Wells Fargo that Trump has the power to appoint its regulator.<br/>With a little luck we will get the opportunity to watch him squirm and try to evade scrutiny for his "deals."<br/><br/>If you have not seen the Frontline PBS show on him, and hi personality, it  revel just what kind of personality he is. He never admit a mistake, when called on them he sues, he attacks as we have seen with his personal attacks on his critics and accusers, and he seeks revenge. <br/><br/>We see his treatment of ambassadors as particularly hateful, people who have served Honorably, treated like some kind of enemy, this is the mark of a dictatorial Fascist. He even call the opposition his enemy. Ethics be damned, he is a sociopath, no conscience, a rotten to the core egomaniac.  If CIA can’t even “maximally-demote” Jason Bourne after 14 years “off the grid”, how much respect do you suppose the rest of us owe them?<br/><br/>I’m reminded of my gem on the importance of the press to a free and healthy society – but, then, the manufacturers of prophylactics could be said to contribute as much. CIA’s problem, as with the press, is the single-minded focus on its own importance as the lynchpin to Life, the Universe and Everything.<br/><br/>Let’s cut the kindergarten-nonsense. The leadership of our intelligence services, become RATHER politicized over the past eight years, set out to attack and damage Trump. And failed. So now it’s all umbrage and befuddlement at how he could be questioning the effectiveness of their efforts. The same efforts that concluded by global consensus that Saddam was awash in WMD – even fifteen years ago.<br/><br/>Trump doesn’t need CIA to tell him that Iran is ignoring its “accord” commitments: he knows they are (IAEA is telling him), which is why it may have another three months of life before it gets drop-kicked into the Persian Gulf.<br/><br/>Humor at this self-involvement aside, we all know about that wall at Langley covered by nameless stars, and we all have immense respect and gratitude for CIA and the dedication of its members – as, I’m sure, does Trump as well. But he’s under political attack, and whether or not CIA accepts it they’re abetting those attacks. But soon it will be TRUMP’S CIA and not Obama’s, and we can finally get beyond all this.A crazy person with a gun is bad enough.  A crazy person with an army is even worse.  Did anybody who voted for this loose cannon think this through?  He was extremely defensive about his short fingers, but he's apparently all for small arms.<br/><br/>A silly tweet-happy buffoon is joining forces with gun nuts while making second-amendment jokes.  Apparently he forgot that Sarah Palin's Facebook page put crosshairs on legislators who were pro-Obamacare, including Gabrielle Giffords.  "Don't Retreat-Instead, RELOAD!" was the caption.  Shortly thereafter, a crazy guy with a gun shot her in the head and killed six people in the process.<br/><br/>Maybe the Second Amendment is nothing to joke about.<br/><br/>All Democrats have been asking for were background checks to prevent known crazies from getting weapons.  But frankly, background checks are unreliable.  Case in point: no one's background demonstrated dishonesty, a history of sexual assault, a serious intellectual deficit and an almost-certain diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder more than our president-defect, but that wasn't enough to disqualify him from a job where he could get his hands on nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Face it, America.  We shot ourselves in the foot when we elected this guy.  We're supposed to hope that he'll become more measured in office.  But when asked what he will do when he becomes president, he replies with one word: reload. @Dan<br/><br/>Well it missed 9/11 and also the end of the Soviet Union - that very week it warned Reagan that the Soviet Union was getting stronger.  <br/><br/>If you want a non flag waving view of the CIA read "Legacy of Ashes" by Tim Weiner and also the review of that book on the CIA webpage. BTW the title comes from President Eisenhower, who bemoaning his failure to reform the CIA said he was  turning over to JFK a legacy of ashes (referring to the CIA). JFK learned the truth when the CIA ran the Bay of Pigs operation. Three university professors of psychology have written to President Obama to ask for such testing by an impartial group of experts.also quick solve. liked the number clue for sedate and convertible for sofa bed.@Dan<br/><br/>If you want to get the flavor of the book here is the NY Times review with a long list of world shaking events that the CIA missed.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Thomas-t.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Thomas-t.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Thomas-t.html</a>Typical Luettgen evading of the issue.<br/>I is not if Trump's appointees are self made billionaires, they are not. It is not a liberal conservative issue, it is a matter of what the law is.<br/><br/>The law is one that requires disclosure of conflicting interests, and divestiture of them before assuming the position. Are they honest or dishonest, are they deliberately avoiding complying with the law, are they being enabled to do so, by the GOP legislators?<br/><br/>RL just cant stick to the facts, it is his MO to try and confuse the issue. We al know his animus toward liberals and anyone who does not worship Il Duce. Twist the facts, confuse the issue, oh follower of Nietzsche, al the worlds problems can be solved by a few authoritarians, so says RL.<br/><br/>I just came back from Spain where they are still celebrating the end of one of these strong men,nor much different than Trump. This is a sad era in our history,he would have been despised all our previous presidents. Many years ago I had two very early miscarriages that I mistook at the time for late and painful periods.  I did not realize what they really were until after my son was born.  I am able to look at them as nothing much, just happenstances that enabled me to have the two children I later conceived--I'd never have had more than two.  But new technology recognizes pregnancies so much earlier now.  I'm sure I'd have wanted a way to grieve those first two little ones had I known them to be such.Looking at production and nonsupervisory employees shows less robust wage growth which has been stuck at 2.5% yoy since December 2015:<br/><br/><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=cir9" title="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=cir9" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=cir9</a><br/><br/>That the average hourly earnings of all private employees is rising faster at now 2.9% yoy implies rising inequality of labor income.<br/><br/>Also, after-tax corporate profits still take an unusually high share of GDP even after falling from a recent record high of 10% in Q4 2011.  As of Q3 2016 profits are still taking in large 8.4% share of the economy, which is well above the historical norms as can be seen here;<br/><br/><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=ciAX" title="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=ciAX" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=ciAX</a><br/><br/>The point here is that wages can still rise a lot from here without threatening rising inflation.  It's normal for the profits share to rise during the early stages of recovery from recession but then decline in the later stages of an expansion.  That pattern is clear from the chart above.Russia hacked the DNC and selected Democratic operatives, then embarrassingly WikiShafted them, largely to damage Hillary Clinton's election chances. But really to damage Hillary Clinton. Yet, if you're going to call Putin a "Nazi", something not usually heard from a U.S. Sec. of State at the time (does she even understand the devastation the Nazis wreaked in Russia?), then you MIGHT just expect some blowback.<br/><br/>So, don't get angry ... get even. And not by kicking out a few third-rate spooks and shutting down a couple of bordellos.<br/><br/>So, can we finally get beyond this? We're going to be just astonished at how all this outrage diminishes after 20 January, when CIA is no linger Obama's (who blew it by doing nothing about the hacking as it was happening) but Trump's. If it had been Trump's CIA months ago, we'd probably have fed Putin "fake news" in the hack about what a great buy Republic Airways was; and by now Putin would be broke.paul - Hmmm, a thousand pardons, sir; we were indeed less than precise in this little Fri. eve post, and should have been scrupulous in our verbiage, instead saying " As Dr. K. reminds, this part of the economic cycle is not when Keynes would advocate deficit spending ".<br/><br/>Hopefully all confusion is now allayed :)<br/><br/>Raising taxes to achieve better economic results is another discussion.Gail left out one bit. Lots of people will react to this by going out and buying another or a more powerful gun or guns and ammunition. Evan Osnos did some interesting research on how the NRA and guns marketers discovered they could manufacture a change in attitude, an increase in fear, to sell more guns. <br/><br/>"Making a Killing: The business and politics of selling guns" <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/after-orlando-examining-the-gun-business" title="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/after-orlando-examining-the-gun-business" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/after-orlando-examining-the...</a><br/><br/>Trump, whose main skill is marketing, would of course catch on to how he could enhance his sales pitch this way, along with the NRA support.<br/><br/>This desire to be able to kill people easily seems mad to me. Yet any time anyone says, a dead person is dead, their rights have been finally and comprehensively removed, those who want to be able to cause that finality with ease and without reserve tell us we're treading on their toes.<br/><br/>What about the finality of death is invisible to people? What about the humanity of other people is hidden from them?<br/><br/>Lots of otherwise decent people seem to lose their minds when it comes to guns. There is vast evidence that the presence of a casually stored gun in the home or elsewhere is much more likely to result in innocents being killed than anything else.<br/><br/>All my life I've been able to walk around without thinking about other people's guns. But there are people who feel I should be forced to arm myself. Why would I want to look at other people with suspicion and fear?<br/><br/>Let me be humane!@Bewrnard Edmonds<br/><br/>What are you some kind of a nut - I don't want any crank mail, but you must love the attention (if you are using your real name.<br/><br/>The following is excerpted from the NY Times review of Legacy of Ashes:<br/><br/>When Henry Kissinger traveled to China in 1971, Prime Minister Chou En-lai asked about C.I.A subversion. Kissinger told Chou that he  vastly overestimates the competence of the C.I.A"               <br/><br/>The C.I.A. never did have much luck operating inside Communist China, and it failed to predict the Iranian revolution of 1979.  The agency also did not foresee the<br/><br/>explosion of an atom bomb by the Soviet Union in 1949, the invasion of South<br/>Korea in 1950, the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe in the 1950s, the installation of Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962, the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the explosion of an atom bomb by India in 1998 - the list goes on and on, culminating in the agency's wrong call on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in 2002-3.<br/><br/>The CIA has a great reputation but a terrible record - it is inept.  And yet the myth of the C.I.A. as an all-knowing, all-powerful spy agency persisted for years, not just in the minds of America's enemies but in the imagination of many American television-watchers and moviegoersNOBODY, and I mean NOBODY, could be worse than Trump.NO RNC information was ever divulged.  Wonder WHY???I'd like very much to see evidence of increasing rate of participation in the job market, and preferably of a decrease in the rate of that increase AFTER some growth, before pronouncing the economy anywhere near full employment.<br/><br/>A nearby business can stand as an example of what's nice, but not good enough: a restaurant that was "Opening Soon!" for a couple of years finally opened.  Something was encouraging enough to make that potential business with its jobs actual.  But it isn't an example of anyone entirely changing intentions and increasing employment.PEOTUS’ staff’s statement issued this afternoon attempts to pivot public attention toward whether or not voting machines were tampered with in this election. It’s a clever canard, but that’s not the crime that was committed here. The hacking and leaking of phished email begins with the crime of impersonation. It’s illegal in many states and or prosecuted under existing wire fraud statutes.<br/>Russian operatives developed a full blown playbook around stolen email content that dates back to 2009 -when they conducted their first effective hack and leak operation against climate scientists that became known as Climategate.  The victims still refer to it to this day as a smear campaign. Its effective because the public assumes that leaked email content is part of "transparency" when in fact stolen and manipulated information has zero integrity. It was obtained illegally.<br/>PEOTUS’ team would have us believe that the election results were some sort of coronation, but  in fact more people attended last month's Army/Navy game than provided the margin of victory in the three blue wall states. Bottom line, when you factor in Russian Operatives' role in manipulating the results this was certainly no electoral marvel. It was a squeaker  (3rd narrowest margin in election history) with the difference being the assist from lawless operators based in the soviet republic. It is time to for Mr. Trump to step aside and for Mr. Pence to be named<br/>President.  He is no better than Trump, except that Pence does not appear to be a con artist.<br/><br/>And one has to ask, if the situation were reversed, do you think that the Republicans would be following the law like the Democrats?  No.  Republicans will risk the very foundations of this republic to "win" political contests.  <br/><br/>Consider the 2000 election and the Republican Supreme Court ordering the ballot recount to stop in Florida handing the election to Bush.<br/><br/>Consider the Senate's refusal to even hold hearings on the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's demise.  <br/><br/>Consider the "fake" news attacks funded by the Koch brothers and their ilk.<br/><br/>Consider the letter by Director Comey eleven days or so before the election that was so damaging to Secretary Clinton.<br/><br/>Consider the housing crisis in 2007 and 2008 that President Obama had to clean up.<br/><br/>Consider the Republicans stated intention in 2009 to prevent Obama from getting anything done.<br/><br/>Consider the pending repeal of the ACA and the Republicans's refusal to discuss the issue in the House and Senate to improve it. <br/><br/>When Republicans win elections it means big business makes big money.  <br/><br/>We no longer have a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  It is time to bring it back.  A good place to start is for Mr. Trump to resign. Hopefully the lawful articles of the Constitution can be properly applied and this lawlessness can be stopped.I cannot understand how a democracy that supposedly adheres to the rule of law and a fair and honest election process cannot see there way to immediately having another presidential election after being informed by there very own intelligence group that the candidates did not have an equal playing field during the entire election process; is it a matter of cost ? if not what else could it be? the incoming Donald Trump is not yet president. there is still a very capable President in charge and I am certain he could continue on until people could be assured the incoming person would be the actual one who had gotten there in a fair and legitimate run electionTrump is a compulsive liar.<br/>First he in his statement after he met with the Intelligence Chiefs he states that the Russian actions had no effect on the elections , the report did not state that in fact it concludes that they do not know if there was any effect.<br/>So the question remains.<br/>Suffice to say Putins hacking, passing on the results to Wikileaks had the clear objective of harming Ms Clinton as per the report. The fact Putin achieved his objective means that the probability that it influenced election is clear , no one can deny that the leaks harmed Clinton, reinforced negative perceptions.<br/><br/>The other lie ( there are so many) is that he promised to tell the American people what information he had , that no one else had on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.So far nothing.<br/><br/>I hope the media keeps the pressure on him and his surrogatesTrump enters office with the lowest share (largest deficit) of the popular vote in 140 years.<br/><br/>Of course Putin's campaign influenced more than the 100,000 votes in the battleground states that provided the razor thin margin of victory in the Electoral College. <br/><br/>It takes a state actor to target disinformation in vulnerable states with precision. <br/><br/>Brexit was also a close vote based on disinformation. <br/><br/>Russia is attacking western democracy.I would imagine that your average President makes 5 = 10 necessarily immediate decisions / day on deeply classified intelligence.  None of the two - three weeks of tweeted nonsense and "prove it to me" disingenuous blather the Donald has issued.<br/><br/>Will he make the required quick decisions with due attention and proper regard to the daily intelligence?  Will it be blended with the last Breitbart / Infowars assessments.<br/><br/>Good luck to us all.  Fortunately, it looks like the building ridicule of Trump's foolishness will bring him quickly to the "this is no fun, and they're making me lose money" departure point within a month or two.<br/><br/>At any rate, before Russia's direct manipulation of him due to undisclosed conflicts or revelation of (likely) cached blackmail material occur.Surely the intelligence community can probe into Trump's taxes and financial dealings to investigate his ties to Russian government and whether or not he benefits financially from Russian interests. He has given every reason to be suspicious of his refusal to denounce a foreign government hacking US government servers, and even publicly asked them to do so during his campaign. <br/><br/>If they are not motivated to investigate him for the sake of national security, and are not capable of finding the information necessary to draw a conclusion, then they are as incompetent as he claims they are. I surely don't want him to be proven right about that, because he is the epitome of all that is wrong with our country, and we need adult minds in the government to courageously protect us. No. We were not greater then.<br/>Being drafted wasn't the only way we learned to work together. The Vietnam generation was learning how to work together back home, too. To stop the war. Against dress codes that forced you girls and women to wear dresses or skirts at school and work. For equality. For the environment. Even Woodstock was part of the greatness. <br/><br/>And we are still a great nation. <br/><br/>The difference is that the people aren't in charge any more. The number of millionaires and billionaires has reached critical mass and corporations decide what our choices are. And no, corporations are not people.  Then there's the military industrial complex. Back then Eisenhower warned us and we failed to listen. <br/><br/>I've got a 16 year old. There's no way he's going to be conscripted to increase profits for the war machine or to build a wall of separation. <br/><br/>If the people that make this country great were allowed a voice the consensus would be that we've all come to look for America. <br/><br/>Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together. I've got some real estate here in my bag.....Does police brutality exist? Absolutely! However, let us not forget that each officer has their own previous experiences, fears, and personalities (good, bad and ugly) and bring their "baggage" to the job.<br/>Ex: The officer that meekly spoke to the white boy may naturally be a passive person and react to all citizens in that manner. A volital officer may have also been impulsive and angry during his youth-with people of all races.<br/>At what point do we become more selective of the officers we hire and train? Perhaps we pay officers a competitive salary  and attract more qualified, stable and college educated officers. I believe we would see a significant decline in police brutality.Great article!  Hats off to M. Schwartz and the brave Mexican journalists. The article is very pertinent to our times.The question about the ex-wife and the new girlfriend raises an interesting and I think ongoing problem, not yet addressed, but one which ought to figure into the first wife's decision.  <br/><br/>If the ex-wife is correct, we already know that the ex-husband has acquired two beards.<br/><br/>Sure, she can warn number two, but what about the inevitable numbers three, four, five and so on?The lack of commentary on here even mentioning animal agriculture concerns me. Yes, transportation emissions are a contributor to climate change, but livestock and its byproducts are responsible for 32 million tons of CO2 each year (51% of all greenhouse gas emissions).  <br/><br/>Methane (the greenhouse gas resulting from animal agriculture) is 25-100 times more destructive than CO2, and has a much higher potential for global warming.  <br/><br/>Animal agriculture is responsible for 80-90% of water consumption:<br/>2,500 gallons per 1lb of beef<br/>1,000 gallons per 1 gallon of milk<br/>900 gallons per 1 lb of cheese<br/><br/>Internationally, cows drink 45 billion gallons of water and eat 135 billion lbs of grain each day. We currently grow enough food to feed 10 billion people, but at least 50% of that supply is fed to the livestock. About 82% of starving children live in countries where the food is fed to animals and the animals are eaten by western nations. Starving children exactly like Tsapasoa and Fombasoa. <br/><br/>Reducing consumption of animal products will eventually decrease the impact of the animal agriculture industry. This change is urgent as the animal agriculture industry affects everything and everyone on this planet. Instead of lamenting the condition of the environment through social media posts and shares, please consider how you personally can create change through your actions. Perhaps along the way, compassion for animals will also find a place. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/" title="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/" target="_blank">http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/</a>Vietnam was a tragedy and profound political and military miscalculation at every step, starting with JFK.<br/><br/>Over 2.7 million US served, 304,000 were injured, 58,154 died and 500,000 still suffer from PTSD today, according to the VA.<br/><br/>The deaths of the Vietnamese include 1.3 million military and up to 2 million civilians. This was followed by another war between Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge. <br/><br/>The lessons of Vietnam were totally lost on Bush-Cheney, who unleashed similar chaos in the Middle East.<br/><br/>But those lessons were clear to President Obama. While the US did the fighting, the Iraqis were fracturing along sectarian lines, Shiite, Sunni and Kurd.  Shiite President  al Maliki subsequently tried to squeeze as much power and wealth for his cronies, while the half starved Sunni troops ran away at the first ISIS assault, abandoning US  weapons and vehicles.<br/><br/>Now Iraqis of all sects are fighting and dying together for their country and slowly defeating ISIS. Right up to the election of Trump, it looked like we avoided another Vietnam. <br/><br/>Now with Fake News Flynn as NSA, almost anything can happen.

But it imports one part of that from its own overseas subsidiary, and "pays" a very high price for that part. Now there is no profit in the US. The profit is in the subsidiary, which just happens to be in a place that does not tax that. Magic. No taxes.<br/><br/>Of course that is supposed to be illegal. That is what accountants and lawyers are paid to take care of. It can be handled. It is. Often. For a LOT of money. Trillions.<br/><br/>That money then remains offshore, waiting for a tax amnesty to come home. There have been two recently, and talk of a third.<br/><br/>This system would defeat that. If the cash is spent here, it is taxed here, no matter where they "move" their internal allocation of profit.<br/><br/>Now again, this is supposed to be illegal. There are dodges. It happens in vast amounts. That is why there are trillions waiting for the next tax amnesty. Those who deny it are only saying in public what they say to the IRS -- they have to say it, but we don't have to be so stupid as to believe it.<br/><br/>That distorts the economy too. And collecting tax on all that "distorts" too by making them pay their tax.<br/><br/>Yes, it has its problems and its down sides. Odd that this article makes no slightest mention of this huge upside. Trillions.The issue is how access the $2.5 trillion that the Fortune 500 has in offshore tax havens, and how to prevent it from happening again. So far the proposal is a 20% tax on imported items; cars, car parts, clothes, gasoline, and for those who care to look pretty much most goods in stores these days. Such a tax will add a dose of reality to the economists who claim that manufacturing employment is down because of automation and not imports, when we see the volume and variety of goods that are taxed because they are imports. If automation were the primary reason for the loss of manufacturing most goods would still state 'Made in the USA', and not be subject to the additional tax for imports. <br/><br/>The concern is how the WTO will view the system, and eventually if other countries would adapt a similar tax policy. Of course a key selling point of any tax overhaul sponsored by Republicans will be that it's "revenue neutral."  What that means is the share of government taxes paid by corporations won't go up -- they will likely go down as lobbying proceeds.  So while it might address one part of the mess, this overhaul doesn't address the inherent unfairness in the tax system.  But that's not a Republican concern.The economy is not in a normal state.  Polling and interviews show that people voted for Trump because of the abnormality, and a recent paper by Jaimovich and Siu () shows that recent recessions are accompanied by jobless recoveries insofar as routine work is concerned.  Automation is here.<br/>Eliminating mind-numbing routine work is not a bad thing--work should not be oppressive--but job displacement is.  The economy is in transition:  white collar workers have adapted as their jobs became knowledge work, but routine jobs are not a transition to knowledge work.  Can the displaced be helped by GOP deficit spending?  I very much doubt it, but ignoring the issue does the public a disservice.I'm sure I'm not the first to point this out, but an aardvark is not the same thing as an anteater, and so an anteater is also not the same thing as an antbear. Not to be too snide, but I would think that someone who loves anteaters would be able to distinguish them from aardvarks. I find the anti-Russia hysteria being whipped up quite remarkable. People's critical faculties are paralyzed with disorientation and fear. Like after 9/11, when trumped up WMD tall tales set the world on a path towards ISIS and God-knows what next. Have no Americans heard of the NED --- the National Endowment for Democracy? Ask the Venezuelans, for example, about U.S. meddling in elections. Espionage and counter-espionage go on all, the time. It is an endless game. Like you and your personal data, which everyone and their uncle helps themselves to every minute of every day. What is never at issue in these stories about Russia! are the nasty little tricks the DNC did to keep Bernie out of the White House and the Clinton campaign's lousy strategy, especially in the closing days of the election. What you have are the neoliberals/necons/cold warrior establishment types trying to keep their hand son the wheel and lunatic Republicans poised to drive the USA -- is not the entire world -- off a cliff. I just happened to be reading chapter one of Robert O. Paxton's definitive work. "The Anatomy of Fascism," where he describes the confused despondency that followed WWI, an atmosphere for which left and right were inadequate and that occurred because liberal and conservative had failed. Like now. Uncertainly, jockeying for power. It is truly remarkable how shameless propaganda actually can be. All those governments toppled by the CIA denied with a straight face. There is a direct correlation between the decline in the quality and content of our education and the rise of alternate news realities that growing segments of our population accept. We've come to the point where depending on where one stands in this polarized society, they will only accept the news that are meted out by like-minded outlets. It used to be that "crazy" was relegated to the Inquirer and most people accepted what they read in Time, Newsweek, Washington Post, and the New York Times.<br/><br/>The way to undo the damage done by the Foxification of our news, ultimately, is to make foundational correction in the single biggest inequity in our society. What is the one thing all members of the elite get? An excellent education, founded on the best, broadest font of knowledge in the humanities.<br/><br/>How did Trump, a man whose expressive language is of a very young 8 year old make such an impact on so many millions of voters and to on to get elected? Ronald Dworkin was right, our declining system of education has put democracy at-risk: <a href="http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1pI" title="http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1pI" target="_blank">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1pI</a> Where did Steve Bannon go to school after a stint in the Navy? Georgetown University. He got an elite education. Where did Ted Cruz get his education? He went to Harvard. <br/><br/>Give every citizen in every state the same high-quality public education, from pre-K to 12th grade. <a href="http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1qI" title="http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1qI" target="_blank">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1qI</a> Make college, whether technical or academic, free. That is how Breitbart and Fox News will be made irrelevant. Sorry, but the clue should be FBI'S DEPT, not FBI'S DIV."Vietnam changed us as a country. In many ways, for the worse: It made us cynical and distrustful of our institutions, especially of government."<br/><br/>Those were not the first times our government lied to us. It was not even in the first century of lies. Read Abraham Lincoln about the Mexican War, about which he said the same things while running for Congress.<br/><br/>We are not changed for the worse, if we catch on, finally.<br/><br/>We'd be for the worse if the lies were new, if this had not been happening.<br/><br/>It is all for the best if we finally figure it out, catch on, hold our government to a higher standard, finally.<br/><br/>For awhile after Vietnam, we harbored a distrust was called the Vietnam Syndrome, and it limited government wars and inhibited government lies (didn't end them).<br/><br/>Then the Persian Gulf War victory euphoria "cured" us of the Vietnam Syndrome. <br/><br/>Then we trusted again, for a short while, even through Bill Clinton's shenanigans. Until finally W and Cheney got hold of power and showed us some of the mothers of all lies.<br/><br/>Are we worse for knowing? Or were we worse for trusting W and Cheney?<br/><br/>I'd say it is not worse, not even cynical, to distrust what ought to be distrusted.My god, DL, that sounds awful, and I remember from Psych 1 that each repetition only increases one's aversion to a painful or unpleasant experience. I wonder if maybe that amnesiac kind of agent could at least make it seem like the experience never happened, but I guess you and your docs have considered that to no avail. Here's to next Wednesday.  Oh, but so many of us have the ability--the ability to become parents.  That's the rub.Anything that eliminates corporations leaving the United States, because of high corporate tax rates, and becoming domiciled in foreign nations, such as Ireland, where the effective tax, as is the case with Apple, is 2%, is a very good thing, and long overdue.<br/><br/>It seems the United States of America has been relegated to be the insatiable maw, for products made anywhere but in the United States, specifically designed for the enrichment of the global elite.I am appalled at the percentages quoted here--40-50% of babies are insecure?  That's horrid!Your statement that the new tax arrangement eliminates "the incentive to play games with overseas companies" seems to miss a key point.  If overseas affiliate companies continue to own the valuable intellectual property (e.g. Apple's iPhone technology) then the domestic company must pay the foreign company to use the technology -- the cash leaves the US and goes to an affiliated company overseas in a low tax jurisdiction. That reduces domestic cash flow and accordingly reduces the tax under the new structure.  I don't see that the new arrangement addresses offshoring of intellectual property for tax avoidance.   The effect would be similar to the existing situation: cash piles up overseas in low tax jurisdictions.DL—When the waiting room TV is on Fox "News," either they agree to change the channel or turn it off, or they have seen the last of me at that office.Aardvarks eat ants.

Breitbart, as always, has turned this backwards.<br/><br/>"For 30 years I have viewed the prosecution of the Perry County Three as a cautionary tale.

He thinks they are ungodly, but it is he who ignores the gospels and the teachings of Jesus, to care for each other and our world.Deficit spending requires the government to sell bonds which competes with other kinds of investment like corporate bonds and mortgages and crowds out investment. The additional government spending creates jobs, but the reduction in private spending because they can't borrow as much money reduces jobs cancelling it out. "Crowding in" is a much less common term, but it refers to when government spending when we are in a liquidity trap has the the opposite effect and actually increases private spending and private job creation rather than reducing it.I believe Deval Patrick wrote a letter to the Denate recommending against confirmation based on his early role in defending two African Americans in a specious and silly case presided ove by none other than Mr. trump's nominee for Justice.The New York Times needs to take a page from more serious reporting. Occasionally they do real reporting, but day after day we can reliably count on opinionating rather than informing. For example, we are looking at history-making floods in California, but where is that news? All over the globe, extreme weather is providing daily evidence of change. This accumulating information is something everyone needs to know. Denial of climate science and global warming/climate change would not be so easy if reporting followed its duty to tell the story.<br/><br/>In the end, the planet is more powerful than the mountebank and his kleptocracy, and their eagerness to shut down science and silence their critics.

This is quite likely to happen about the time when Trump's foolish policies result in consequences that voters hate.  There is nothing like being proven to have made a terrible decision to motivate a person to learn how to make better ones.<br/><br/>A healthy democracy requires an well-informed electorate equiped to understand the relevant information.  We will either convince American voters that having the facilities to lie easily, to hurl purile insults based on irrelevancies, to avoid civilized discussion, are not the qualities that make for a successful leader.   Our choices are only between educating voters or excluding them from the process of choosing their leaders, in other words giving up on democracy.  The first choice is the better one, and Paul Krugman is the best popular educator on topics that voters need to understand.  Not all good medicine is fun to take.extra puzzler -- sports bra changed to sports bar. Good Monday. Goatherd reminds me of The Sound of Music. Julie Andrews was just host of the New Year's celebration with the Vienna Philharmonic.“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, [he] walks into mine.”<br/><br/>Sen. Jeff Sessions is a hard-case for law enforcement: former federal prosecutor in Bama (successful one), he NEVER votes to empty our prisons. Now, this worldview is appropriate in the U.S. Senate, where ALL the many worldviews of Americans are represented. But as our AG, running the U.S. dept. charged with serving as last bulwark against racism and unfairness in America? Hmmm.<br/><br/>To answer the editorial question, Sen. Sessions is a man hiding in plain sight. He is a recognized champion for a racial balance in America that does his middle name, “Beauregard”, proud. Would he ignore law or make it up in that interest? No, I don’t believe he would. Would he make excuses for what most Americans regard as outrageous racial and ethnic prejudice? Perhaps not pursue it energetically, allowing us to sink back into some retrograde, freckled version of Jim Crow, not so murderous but a hideous return nonetheless to a watered-down version of Hell? I’m … not so sure.<br/><br/>And my lack of sureness is frightening to me.<br/><br/>Trump’s nominees, to me, represent legitimate choices of the political winner: lower taxes, dramatically less suffocating regulation, a decided contempt for political correctness. You don’t like that? Well, elections have consequences, as President Obama was fond of reminding Republicans. All Trump’s nominees but one: Jeff Beauregard Sessions, junior senator from the great state of AL, as our AG."He is a recognized champion for a racial balance in America that does his middle name, “Beauregard”, proud."<br/><br/>You almost got this one right, Richard. It's his first name that is more relevant in making him proud as a champion of white supremacy.

Those of us with decent memories don't fall for it. NONE of Trump's nominees are "tainted" BUT for Jeff Sessions. They simply espouse different worldviews than you do, gemli. If you'd thought that was a problem, you might have considered moving temporarily to Chicago, voting several thousand times for Mrs. Clinton, then convincing the authorities of several upper-Midwest rustbelt states to extradite all those spurious votes to tip the balance. But it seems that you, like Mrs. Clinton, made altogether too many bad assumptions a couple of months ago, and now will need to abide the consequences. Your berserker support of Bernie Sanders to the bitter end and to the embarrassment of Mrs. Clinton must be particularly galling right about now. <br/><br/>Revolt away. The more recent forebears of Jeff Sessions learned how THAT form of protest is handled here. You need to cut Sessions some slack as Alabama AG. We must all remember that AL was one of the states, not so long ago, that thought castration of the mentally challenged was appropriate protection against the dangers they represented to the virtue of nice, polite white women. So, defending death sentences for those of them convicted of committing murder can't be TOO hard to understand.<br/><br/>Sessions's record in in AL, as prosecutor and as state AG with regard to BOTH the mentally challenged and most clearly the non-freckled, was (and is) hardly outstanding in the South. But, then, we usually don't regard such pillars as suitable candidates for U.S. attorney general. Rima:<br/><br/>How dare you tarnish the great name of Jefferson Davis?<br/><br/>"Jefferson Davis was proud of slavery.

I don't think this is wise.  The Fed would do well to keep interest rates low until we invest in infrastructure, especially the the bad infrastructure that threatens public safety or is a drag on the efficiency of the economy.<br/><br/>You know better than anyone that bridge and tunnel building have high multipliers and can have a very beneficial effect on incomes.  <br/><br/>I also strongly believe that we should invest in developing technologies that can capture and sequester carbon dioxide as quickly as possible.  Even if we must redirect the missions of our Federal Labs.  The private sector is not doing this, so we need to treat this as a national security emergency. <br/><br/> I also believe we should eliminate the barriers to development and deployment of sustainable energy technologies.  I don't think people realize the potential for collapse if we persist in avoiding the fossil fuel problem.  We are moving much too slowly.  The risk is too great.  <br/><br/>So I strongly believe we should invest in R&amp;D in electric power generation, Interstate Maglev Logistics transport such as that proposed by the late Senator Moynihan.

I understand the reluctance to leave the world of economics where you are a superstar and become just another student of philosophy it is here you are needed.<br/>Why are we even talking debt and deficit in a world of negative interest in developed countries.<br/>Neoliberalism has seen the the private sector have so much money we have imposed penalties on having too much. Economics is broken beyond repair and disquietude blamed on the election of a regime that puts all it faith in economic growth is not an alarm over a man who does not understand our economic system but the election of a regime that will never understand that change happens.<br/>There are those of us that state the basis of the modern Western Nation State is interest. Negative interest tells me it is a brand new ballgame.  I am not a Christian but the concept of chasing the moneylenders from the temple fills me with optimism. The fact that if we borrow enough we won't need taxes. This isn't wonkdom this is arithmetic.Looking at Chart 5 from a recent report from the BLS (link given below), we might want to ask the Times to remove Krugman's fake news. He writes.<br/>"Wages are finally rising, quit rates are back to pre-crisis levels, so we seem to be fairly close to full employment, and the Fed is raising rates."<br/><br/>Hardly. No need to argue over interpretation, he's trying to deceive you into thinking we have full employment. This is refuted by actual data. While a majority of 125 million voters agreed with this deception, American economy is great, an all important 50,000 in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania seemed to have a firmer grip on reality. Again, looking at actual data, not only were quit rates pre recession pretty underwhelming (see the other link I'm providing), but the Chart 5 from first link shows the same number of hires and quits ten years later, as if the the economy had not grown at all. Openings are up considerably because employers won't raise wages and have learned just to keep an elevated level of openings. Otherwise you would see more hires. There is no skills shortage.  Real wages (nominal minus inflation) are barely up 1%, the gains skewed to upper incomes, aided by oil price induced low inflation still rippling through economy, and DNWR which coasts well above 0% for most workers. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf" title="https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.bls.gov/web/jolts/jlt_labstatgraphs.pdf</a><br/><a href="http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters" title="http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters" target="_blank">http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/we-need-more-quitters</a><br/><br/>We are five years away from full employment, at least.A wonderful quote that sparked my memories of amazing bird behaviors.
